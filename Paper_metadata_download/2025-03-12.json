            "summary": "We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the\nchallenging lyrics-to-song problem--by introducing YuE, a family of\nopen foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE\nscales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while\nmaintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal\nmelodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1)\ntrack-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2)\nstructural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3)\na multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In\naddition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation,\nenabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an\nEnglish rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional\ngeneration. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or\neven surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility.\nIn addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support\nfor tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned\nrepresentations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the\nresults of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE\nbenchmark.

Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level\nmixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for\nboth understanding and generation tasks.

However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5\nand Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text\nrendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural\nnuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native\nChinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across\ndiverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and\nEnglish, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a\npowerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption\nsystem that balances the accuracy and richness for image description.\nParticularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large\nlanguage model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge\ndirectly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images\nwith accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either\nChinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible\ncharacter-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to\nuntrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT\nand RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics,\ntext rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been\noptimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with\nhuman preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it\ncan be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as\nSeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following\nand image consistency.",

Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been\noptimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with\nhuman preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it\ncan be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as\nSeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following\nand image consistency.",

The representations\ngenerated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of\ndownstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and\nretrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark\n(MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini\nEmbedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models,\ndemonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code\nbenchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad\nselection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.",

            "summary": "While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable\nhigh-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world\nlong videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high\ncomputational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free\napproaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation,\nspecifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content\nchanges. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of\nsemantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose\nSynchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that\nsynchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range\nconsistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two\ncomplementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling,\nwhich ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence,\nrespectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns\ndenoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended\ncontent changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS\nsynchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise,\nensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive\nexperiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video\ngeneration, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence,\noutperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

            "summary": "Instruction-following retrievers have been widely adopted alongside LLMs in\nreal-world applications, but little work has investigated the safety risks\nsurrounding their increasing search capabilities. We empirically study the\nability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and\nwhen used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we\ninvestigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find\nthat given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select\nrelevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for\n61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with\ninstruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can\nbe surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we\nshow that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious\nrequests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary,\nour findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing\nretriever capability.",

        "summary": "Instruction-following retrievers have been widely adopted alongside LLMs in\nreal-world applications, but little work has investigated the safety risks\nsurrounding their increasing search capabilities. We empirically study the\nability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and\nwhen used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we\ninvestigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find\nthat given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select\nrelevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for\n61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with\ninstruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can\nbe surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we\nshow that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious\nrequests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary,\nour findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing\nretriever capability.",

            "summary": "Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision,\nand the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description,\na task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value.\nHowever, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world\nusability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one\nreferring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this\ntask from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and\nmodel architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and\nthree distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a\nnovel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world\napplications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large\nlanguage model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust\nreferring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that\nstate-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like\nRefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple\nindividuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also\ngeneralizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly\napplicable across various perception tasks.

        "title": "Referring to Any Person",
        "summary": "Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision,\nand the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description,\na task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value.\nHowever, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world\nusability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one\nreferring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this\ntask from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and\nmodel architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and\nthree distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a\nnovel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world\napplications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large\nlanguage model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust\nreferring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that\nstate-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like\nRefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple\nindividuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also\ngeneralizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly\napplicable across various perception tasks.

We believe Survival\nGame can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound\ninsights into human intelligence.",

Although existing anonymization methods are able to\nobscure identity information, they often struggle to preserve the utility of\nthe images. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face\nanonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach\nutilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring\noptimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its\ninitial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned\ndiffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized\nface is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports\nlocalized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are\nanonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art\nmethods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and\nimage quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it\nwell-suited for real-world applications. Code and data can be found at\nhttps://github.com/hanweikung/nullface .",

            "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on\nvisual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require\nfine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language\nfeatures are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the\npre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture\nthat leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual\nfeature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER\nselectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are\nsemantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer.\nThis allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen.\nThereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned\nfrom large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization\ncapabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly\noutperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization\nto novel objects and environments.

        "title": "OTTER: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Text-Aware Visual Feature\n  Extraction",
        "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on\nvisual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require\nfine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language\nfeatures are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the\npre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture\nthat leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual\nfeature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER\nselectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are\nsemantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer.\nThis allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen.\nThereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned\nfrom large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization\ncapabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly\noutperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization\nto novel objects and environments.
