In this work, we introduce OmniPaint, a\nunified framework that re-conceptualizes object removal and insertion as\ninterdependent processes rather than isolated tasks. Leveraging a pre-trained\ndiffusion prior along with a progressive training pipeline comprising initial\npaired sample optimization and subsequent large-scale unpaired refinement via\nCycleFlow, OmniPaint achieves precise foreground elimination and seamless\nobject insertion while faithfully preserving scene geometry and intrinsic\nproperties. Furthermore, our novel CFD metric offers a robust, reference-free\nevaluation of context consistency and object hallucination, establishing a new\nbenchmark for high-fidelity image editing.

        "summary": "Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized object-oriented image\nediting, yet their deployment in realistic object removal and insertion remains\nhampered by challenges such as the intricate interplay of physical effects and\ninsufficient paired training data. In this work, we introduce OmniPaint, a\nunified framework that re-conceptualizes object removal and insertion as\ninterdependent processes rather than isolated tasks. Leveraging a pre-trained\ndiffusion prior along with a progressive training pipeline comprising initial\npaired sample optimization and subsequent large-scale unpaired refinement via\nCycleFlow, OmniPaint achieves precise foreground elimination and seamless\nobject insertion while faithfully preserving scene geometry and intrinsic\nproperties. Furthermore, our novel CFD metric offers a robust, reference-free\nevaluation of context consistency and object hallucination, establishing a new\nbenchmark for high-fidelity image editing.

            "summary": "Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive, open-ended language\nqueries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While\nLangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations,\nachieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to\nhandle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot\ncapture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently\ndynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D\nlanguage field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video\nfeatures, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these\nchallenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle\ntime-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes\nefficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision\nfeatures and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video\ncaptions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose\na multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text\nprompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent,\nhigh-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are\nencoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings,\nwhich then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision,\nfacilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces.\nRecognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states,\nwe further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous\nchanges over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both\ntime-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.",

Real-world environments are inherently\ndynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D\nlanguage field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video\nfeatures, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these\nchallenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle\ntime-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes\nefficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision\nfeatures and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video\ncaptions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose\na multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text\nprompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent,\nhigh-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are\nencoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings,\nwhich then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision,\nfacilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces.\nRecognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states,\nwe further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous\nchanges over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both\ntime-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.",

Using a\ncurriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO,\nwe train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in\nsuperior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite\nbeing trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong\ngeneralization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we\nhighlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second\nSFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled\nmodels using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the\n32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.\n  Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning,\nspecifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance.\nWe successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA\nperformance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0\nand 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected\nbehavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.\n  The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch,\nshowcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL.",

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained\nfoundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing\ninference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We\npropose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching\nmodel for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly\ntraining from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid\ndistillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD):\nsCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step\ngeneration fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that\nachieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific\ntraining and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint\nfor real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback\nfor user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in\nspeed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID\nand 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71\nGenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s\n(T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s\n(T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for\nAI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

Notably, these models\nhave been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription\nreliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and\npose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study\nanalyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models,\nqualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study\nquantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its\nviability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this\npaper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of\nwhispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8).

        "summary": "Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for\napplications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription.\nThis paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live\nspeech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models\nhave been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription\nreliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and\npose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study\nanalyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models,\nqualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study\nquantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its\nviability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this\npaper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of\nwhispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that\nquantization reduces latency by 19\\% and model size by 45\\%, while preserving\ntranscription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use\ncases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

However, a comprehensive understanding of\nclassifier-free guidance is still missing.

Building upon prior work by Careil et al., PerCoV2 extends the\noriginal formulation to the Stable Diffusion 3 ecosystem and enhances entropy\ncoding efficiency by explicitly modeling the discrete hyper-latent image\ndistribution. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of recent\nautoregressive methods (VAR and MaskGIT) for entropy modeling and evaluate our\napproach on the large-scale MSCOCO-30k benchmark. Compared to previous work,\nPerCoV2 (i) achieves higher image fidelity at even lower bit-rates while\nmaintaining competitive perceptual quality, (ii) features a hybrid generation\nmode for further bit-rate savings, and (iii) is built solely on public\ncomponents. Code and trained models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Nikolai10/PerCoV2.",

        "title": "PerCoV2: Improved Ultra-Low Bit-Rate Perceptual Image Compression with\n  Implicit Hierarchical Masked Image Modeling",
        "summary": "We introduce PerCoV2, a novel and open ultra-low bit-rate perceptual image\ncompression system designed for bandwidth- and storage-constrained\napplications. Building upon prior work by Careil et al., PerCoV2 extends the\noriginal formulation to the Stable Diffusion 3 ecosystem and enhances entropy\ncoding efficiency by explicitly modeling the discrete hyper-latent image\ndistribution. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of recent\nautoregressive methods (VAR and MaskGIT) for entropy modeling and evaluate our\napproach on the large-scale MSCOCO-30k benchmark. Compared to previous work,\nPerCoV2 (i) achieves higher image fidelity at even lower bit-rates while\nmaintaining competitive perceptual quality, (ii) features a hybrid generation\nmode for further bit-rate savings, and (iii) is built solely on public\ncomponents. Code and trained models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Nikolai10/PerCoV2.",

            "summary": "Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major\ntrustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent\nadvancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states,\nsuch as hidden states, encode the \"overall truthfulness\" of generated\nresponses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs\nfunction and whether they could serve as \"per-token\" hallucination indicators,\nwhich is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an\nin-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and\ndiscover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token\nindicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode\nuniversal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating\nthat there exist \"generic truthful directions\" shared by various LVLMs. Based\non these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt)\nthat first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies\ntruthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further\npropose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination\ndetection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent\nsubspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including\nin-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks.\nExperimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at\nhttps://github.com/jinhaoduan/TruthPrInt.",

        "title": "TruthPrInt: Mitigating LVLM Object Hallucination Via Latent\n  Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention",
        "summary": "Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major\ntrustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent\nadvancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states,\nsuch as hidden states, encode the \"overall truthfulness\" of generated\nresponses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs\nfunction and whether they could serve as \"per-token\" hallucination indicators,\nwhich is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an\nin-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and\ndiscover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token\nindicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode\nuniversal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating\nthat there exist \"generic truthful directions\" shared by various LVLMs. Based\non these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt)\nthat first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies\ntruthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further\npropose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination\ndetection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent\nsubspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including\nin-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks.\nExperimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.
