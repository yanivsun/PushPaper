To overcome these issues, we present RSD,\na new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR\nmodels.

Compared to SR\nmethods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive\nperceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input\nimages, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory.

While recent advancements have shown promising results in\ngenerating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed\ngeneration. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating\ndiffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in\nprevious works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic\nframework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables\nflexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable\nquality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with\nour newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a\nlightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical\nVolume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of\nthe vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder\ndrastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply\nFlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic\nevaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D\ngeneration methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nwhile reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for\ngeneration.

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on\nlarge-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However,\nprevious work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting\nenhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a\nnovel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual\nLanguage Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a\nself-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in\nworld knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world\nenvironments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first\nVLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different\natomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a\nsignificant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of\natomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses\ntraditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and\ndatasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in\nhttps://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.",

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques\nwith foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering\nfeature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of\nknowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works\non feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional\nfeatures for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss\nbetween distilled features and foundation model features. To address these\nchallenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and\nGaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To\nvalidate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature\nsimilarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to\nhighlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach\nencompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language\nmodels (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models\n(LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy\nM3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot.

Despite achieving superior quality,\n4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering\nspeed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of\ntemporal redundancy. (Q1) Short-Lifespan Gaussians: 4DGS uses a large\nportion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics,\nleading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) Inactive Gaussians:\nWhen rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame.\nDespite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in\nredundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present\n4DGS-1K, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we\nintroduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that\neffectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture\nscene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a\nmask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing\nredundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method\nachieves a 41times reduction in storage and 9times faster rasterization\nspeed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.\nPlease see our project page at https://4DGS-1K.github.io.",

Additionally, there\nis no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for\ntrajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and\nsystematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a\nnovel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control\nthrough three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes,\nand sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly\nanimates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object\nconsistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a\nlarge-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated\npipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control\naccuracy across different numbers of objects.

They also\nlack adaptability to varying computational budgets for downstream tasks,\nhindering applications of the most competitive model in real-world scenes. We\nthus propose a new test setting, Token Optimization, for maximized input\ninformation across budgets, which optimizes the size-limited set of input\ntokens through token selection from more suitably sampled videos. To this end,\nwe propose a novel augmentation tool termed Flux. By making the sampling grid\nflexible and leveraging token selection, it is easily adopted in most popular\nvideo training frameworks, boosting model robustness with nearly no additional\ncost. We integrate Flux in large-scale video pre-training, and the resulting\nFluxViT establishes new state-of-the-art results across extensive tasks at\nstandard costs. Notably, with 1/4 tokens only, it can still match the\nperformance of previous state-of-the-art models with Token Optimization,\nyielding nearly 90\\% savings.

        "summary": "Popular video training methods mainly operate on a fixed number of tokens\nsampled from a predetermined spatiotemporal grid, resulting in sub-optimal\naccuracy-computation trade-offs due to inherent video redundancy. They also\nlack adaptability to varying computational budgets for downstream tasks,\nhindering applications of the most competitive model in real-world scenes. We\nthus propose a new test setting, Token Optimization, for maximized input\ninformation across budgets, which optimizes the size-limited set of input\ntokens through token selection from more suitably sampled videos. To this end,\nwe propose a novel augmentation tool termed Flux. By making the sampling grid\nflexible and leveraging token selection, it is easily adopted in most popular\nvideo training frameworks, boosting model robustness with nearly no additional\ncost. We integrate Flux in large-scale video pre-training, and the resulting\nFluxViT establishes new state-of-the-art results across extensive tasks at\nstandard costs. Notably, with 1/4 tokens only, it can still match the\nperformance of previous state-of-the-art models with Token Optimization,\nyielding nearly 90\\% savings. All models and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenGVLab/FluxViT.",

Existing methods\nstruggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are\nconstrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from\ndelayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal\ntokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel\nframework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a\nprobabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information\nloss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during\nlong-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal\ncausal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model\nfully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion\ndecoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches\nwhile offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term\ngeneration, and dynamic motion composition.

In this paper, we introduce DeCapBench along\nwith a novel metric, DCScore, specifically designed for detailed captioning\ntasks. DCScore evaluates hallucinations and fine-grained comprehensiveness by\ndeconstructing responses into the smallest self-sufficient units, termed\nprimitive information units, and assessing them individually. Our evaluation\nshows that DCScore aligns more closely with human judgment than other\nrule-based or model-based metrics. Concurrently, DeCapBench exhibits a high\ncorrelation with VLM arena results on descriptive tasks, surpassing existing\nbenchmarks for vision-language models. Additionally, we present an automatic\nfine-grained feedback collection method, FeedQuill, for preference optimization\nbased on our advanced metric, showing robust generalization capabilities across\nauto-generated preference data. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs\ndemonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces hallucinations but\nalso enhances performance across various benchmarks, achieving superior detail\ncaptioning performance while surpassing GPT-4o.",

        "summary": "Image captioning has long been a pivotal task in visual understanding, with\nrecent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) significantly enhancing\nthe ability to generate detailed image captions. However, the evaluation of\ndetailed image captioning remains underexplored due to outdated evaluation\nmetrics and coarse annotations. In this paper, we introduce DeCapBench along\nwith a novel metric, DCScore, specifically designed for detailed captioning\ntasks. DCScore evaluates hallucinations and fine-grained comprehensiveness by\ndeconstructing responses into the smallest self-sufficient units, termed\nprimitive information units, and assessing them individually. Our evaluation\nshows that DCScore aligns more closely with human judgment than other\nrule-based or model-based metrics. Concurrently, DeCapBench exhibits a high\ncorrelation with VLM arena results on descriptive tasks, surpassing existing\nbenchmarks for vision-language models. Additionally, we present an automatic\nfine-grained feedback collection method, FeedQuill, for preference optimization\nbased on our advanced metric, showing robust generalization capabilities across\nauto-generated preference data. Extensive experiments on multiple VLMs\ndemonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces hallucinations but\nalso enhances performance across various benchmarks, achieving superior detail\ncaptioning performance while surpassing GPT-4o.",

However, their visual\nunderstanding behaviors remain underexplored. A fundamental question arises: to\nwhat extent do LVLMs rely on visual input, and which image regions contribute\nto their responses? It is non-trivial to interpret the free-form generation of\nLVLMs due to their complicated visual architecture (e.g., multiple encoders and\nmulti-resolution) and variable-length outputs. In this paper, we extend\nexisting heatmap visualization methods (e.g., iGOS++) to support LVLMs for\nopen-ended visual question answering. We propose a method to select visually\nrelevant tokens that reflect the relevance between generated answers and input\nimage. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art\nLVLMs on benchmarks designed to require visual information to answer. Our\nfindings offer several insights into LVLM behavior, including the relationship\nbetween focus region and answer correctness, differences in visual attention\nacross architectures, and the impact of LLM scale on visual understanding.

        "title": "Where do Large Vision-Language Models Look at when Answering Questions?",
        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising performance in\nvision-language understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their visual\nunderstanding behaviors remain underexplored. A fundamental question arises: to\nwhat extent do LVLMs rely on visual input, and which image regions contribute\nto their responses? It is non-trivial to interpret the free-form generation of\nLVLMs due to their complicated visual architecture (e.g., multiple encoders and\nmulti-resolution) and variable-length outputs. In this paper, we extend\nexisting heatmap visualization methods (e.g., iGOS++) to support LVLMs for\nopen-ended visual question answering. We propose a method to select visually\nrelevant tokens that reflect the relevance between generated answers and input\nimage. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art\nLVLMs on benchmarks designed to require visual information to answer. Our\nfindings offer several insights into LVLM behavior, including the relationship\nbetween focus region and answer correctness, differences in visual attention\nacross architectures, and the impact of LLM scale on visual understanding. The\ncode and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/bytedance/LVLM_Interpretation.",
