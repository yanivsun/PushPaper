While recent research has focused\non algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has\nbeen overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven\nbottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and\ndecreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining\nreasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to\nmitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method,\nPre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness.\nAdditionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in\nRLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model\nsizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that\nRTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth,\nand then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid\ncapture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial\nimprovements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance\nof careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome\nperformance barriers in RLHF.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning\nlarge language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused\non algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has\nbeen overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven\nbottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and\ndecreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining\nreasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to\nmitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method,\nPre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness.\nAdditionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in\nRLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model\nsizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that\nRTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth,\nand then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid\ncapture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial\nimprovements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance\nof careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome\nperformance barriers in RLHF.",

In contrast, our key insight is to distill\npre-trained foundation models for consistent 4D scene representation, which\noffers promising advantages such as efficiency and generalizability. 1) To\nachieve this, we first animate the input image using image-to-video diffusion\nmodels followed by 4D geometric structure initialization. 2) To turn this\ncoarse structure into spatial-temporal consistent multiview videos, we design\nan adaptive guidance mechanism with a point-guided denoising strategy for\nspatial consistency and a novel latent replacement strategy for temporal\ncoherence. 3) To lift these generated observations into consistent 4D\nrepresentation, we propose a modulation-based refinement to mitigate\ninconsistencies while fully leveraging the generated information. The resulting\n4D representation enables real-time, controllable rendering, marking a\nsignificant advancement in single-image-based 4D scene generation.",

However, existing models still\nstruggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech\ncharacteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that\nthree criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness\n-- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by\nour hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three\ncriteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures\nintricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found\nthat our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug\nit into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to\nthe given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual\nmetric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics\nto assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three\ncriteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with\nour perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually\naccurate lip synchronization.

To apply single-scale ViTs to image\nsegmentation, existing methods adopt a convolutional adapter to generate\nmulti-scale features, a pixel decoder to fuse these features, and a Transformer\ndecoder that uses the fused features to make predictions. In this paper, we\nshow that the inductive biases introduced by these task-specific components can\ninstead be learned by the ViT itself, given sufficiently large models and\nextensive pre-training. Based on these findings, we introduce the Encoder-only\nMask Transformer (EoMT), which repurposes the plain ViT architecture to conduct\nimage segmentation. With large-scale models and pre-training, EoMT obtains a\nsegmentation accuracy similar to state-of-the-art models that use task-specific\ncomponents. At the same time, EoMT is significantly faster than these methods\ndue to its architectural simplicity, e.g., up to 4x faster with ViT-L. Across a\nrange of model sizes, EoMT demonstrates an optimal balance between segmentation\naccuracy and prediction speed, suggesting that compute resources are better\nspent on scaling the ViT itself rather than adding architectural complexity.\nCode: https://www.tue-mps.org/eomt/.",

To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal\nbridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal\nestimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise\ninjection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp\nestimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses\nnormal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation\nfidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality\ndataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric\ndetails, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work\nprovides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images\nby leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.",

        "summary": "With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing\nmethods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing\nfine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent\nambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal\nbridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal\nestimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise\ninjection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp\nestimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses\nnormal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation\nfidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality\ndataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric\ndetails, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work\nprovides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images\nby leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.",

            "summary": "Creating high-fidelity 3D meshes with arbitrary topology, including open\nsurfaces and complex interiors, remains a significant challenge. Existing\nimplicit field methods often require costly and detail-degrading watertight\nconversion, while other approaches struggle with high resolutions. This paper\nintroduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that\nenables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to 1024^3\ndirectly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes\nwith a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions\nand efficiently handling open surfaces. Crucially, we introduce a frustum-aware\nsectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during\nrendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling\nhigh-resolution training. This also allows, for the first time, the\nreconstruction of mesh interiors using only rendering supervision. Building\nupon this, we demonstrate a complete shape modeling pipeline by training a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) and a rectified flow transformer for high-quality\n3D shape generation.

        "summary": "Creating high-fidelity 3D meshes with arbitrary topology, including open\nsurfaces and complex interiors, remains a significant challenge. Existing\nimplicit field methods often require costly and detail-degrading watertight\nconversion, while other approaches struggle with high resolutions. This paper\nintroduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that\nenables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to 1024^3\ndirectly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes\nwith a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions\nand efficiently handling open surfaces. Crucially, we introduce a frustum-aware\nsectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during\nrendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling\nhigh-resolution training. This also allows, for the first time, the\nreconstruction of mesh interiors using only rendering supervision. Building\nupon this, we demonstrate a complete shape modeling pipeline by training a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) and a rectified flow transformer for high-quality\n3D shape generation. Our experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction\naccuracy, with a ~82% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a ~88% increase in\nF-score compared to previous methods, and demonstrate the generation of\nhigh-resolution, detailed 3D shapes with arbitrary topology. By enabling\nhigh-resolution, differentiable mesh reconstruction and generation with\nrendering losses, SparseFlex significantly advances the state-of-the-art in 3D\nshape representation and modeling.",

By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free\nperiod learning, X^2-Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for\ndynamic clinical imaging.

Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger\nprompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive\nperformance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).\nAdditionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on\nreasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks,\nwhere SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text\nsummarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness,\nand factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations.
