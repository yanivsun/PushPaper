In CVTG, image generation models often rendering\ndistorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method.\nTextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text\ninto distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual\ncontent and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus\nenhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the\ngeneration process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG\ntasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present\na new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the\nperformance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.",

However, its applicability to\nbroader domains remains underexplored. In this work, we study the extension of\nRLVR to more diverse domains such as medicine, chemistry, psychology, and\neconomics. We observe high agreement in binary judgments across different large\nlanguage models (LLMs) when objective reference answers exist, which challenges\nthe necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward\nmodels. To address the limitations of binary rewards when handling unstructured\nreference answers, we further incorporate model-based soft scoring into RLVR to\nimprove its flexibility.

To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal\nanti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and\nscenario diversity.

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only 2.5%\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

            "summary": "In the domain of 3D content creation, achieving optimal mesh topology through\nAI models has long been a pursuit for 3D artists. Previous methods, such as\nMeshGPT, have explored the generation of ready-to-use 3D objects via mesh\nauto-regressive techniques. While these methods produce visually impressive\nresults, their reliance on token-by-token predictions in the auto-regressive\nprocess leads to several significant limitations. These include extremely slow\ngeneration speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we\nintroduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh\ngeneration, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete\ntriangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a\ntransformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens\nand decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion\ntransformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the\ndiffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology,\nMeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds\ncompared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an\n800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35times faster than existing baselines).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset\nand demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset. Moreover, it\nintegrates seamlessly with existing conditional guidance strategies, showcasing\nits potential to relieve artists from the time-consuming manual work involved\nin mesh creation.",

This approach guides the model to focus\non more informative and challenging examples, thereby enhancing its reasoning\nability. We evaluate our approach on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Empirical\nresults show that, while the vanilla method yields virtually no improvement\n(0%) on MATH, EAST achieves around a 1% gain over backbone model. On GSM8K,\nEAST attains a further 1-2% performance boost compared to the vanilla method.",

The self-training method has been shown to\nbe effective in reasoning tasks while eliminating the need for external models\nand manual annotations. However, optimizing the use of self-generated data for\nmodel training remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose\nEntropy-Based Adaptive Weighting for Self-Training (EAST), an adaptive\nweighting strategy designed to prioritize uncertain data during self-training.\nSpecifically, EAST employs a mapping function with a tunable parameter that\ncontrols the sharpness of the weighting, assigning higher weights to data where\nthe model exhibits greater uncertainty. This approach guides the model to focus\non more informative and challenging examples, thereby enhancing its reasoning\nability. We evaluate our approach on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Empirical\nresults show that, while the vanilla method yields virtually no improvement\n(0%) on MATH, EAST achieves around a 1% gain over backbone model. On GSM8K,\nEAST attains a further 1-2% performance boost compared to the vanilla method.",
