As these agents increasingly drive AI research\nand practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous\nimprovement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within a modular,\nbrain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science,\nneuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into\nfour interconnected parts. First, we delve into the modular foundation of\nintelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and\noperational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities, and elucidating\ncore components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, and\nemotion-like systems. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive\nevolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their\ncapabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning\nthrough automated optimization paradigms, including emerging AutoML and\nLLM-driven optimization strategies. Third, we examine collaborative and\nevolutionary multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence\nemerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures,\nhighlighting parallels to human social dynamics. Finally, we address the\ncritical imperative of building safe, secure, and beneficial AI systems,\nemphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment,\nrobustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy\nreal-world deployment.",

These phenomena can lead to catastrophic\ndivergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping.\nTraditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based\nmethods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on\nfixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring\nfrequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive\ngradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold\nbased on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior\nreactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without\nmaking any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of\ngradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to\nidentify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes\nwhile not interfering with convergence otherwise.

        "summary": "Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including\ngradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic\ndivergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping.\nTraditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based\nmethods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on\nfixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring\nfrequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive\ngradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold\nbased on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior\nreactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without\nmaking any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of\ngradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to\nidentify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes\nwhile not interfering with convergence otherwise.

To address these, we first design a\ncomprehensive data pipeline to construct prompt-reference-video triplets for\nmodel training. Next, we propose a novel image-text joint embedding model to\ninject multi-element representations into the generative process, balancing\nelement-specific consistency with global coherence and text alignment. We also\noptimize the inference pipeline for both speed and output stability. Moreover,\nwe introduce a carefully curated benchmark for systematic evaluation, i.e, A2\nBench. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse,\nhigh-quality videos with precise element control. SkyReels-A2 is the first\nopen-source commercial grade model for the generation of E2V, performing\nfavorably against advanced closed-source commercial models.

To\nthis end, we introduce ACTalker, an end-to-end video diffusion\nframework that supports both multi-signals control and single-signal control\nfor talking head video generation. For multiple control, we design a parallel\nmamba structure with multiple branches, each utilizing a separate driving\nsignal to control specific facial regions. A gate mechanism is applied across\nall branches, providing flexible control over video generation. To ensure\nnatural coordination of the controlled video both temporally and spatially, we\nemploy the mamba structure, which enables driving signals to manipulate feature\ntokens across both dimensions in each branch. Additionally, we introduce a\nmask-drop strategy that allows each driving signal to independently control its\ncorresponding facial region within the mamba structure, preventing control\nconflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces\nnatural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and that the mamba\nlayer seamlessly integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.",

This study\naddresses this gap by integrating traditional and novel language models with\nfine-tuned Whisper models to raise their performance in less commonly studied\nlanguages. Through rigorous fine-tuning and evaluation across multiple\ndatasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in word error rate,\nparticularly in low-resource scenarios. Our approach not only does take\nadvantage of the extensive data Whisper was pre-trained on, but also\ncomplements its linguistic adaptability by incorporating language models. We\nobtained improvements up to 51\\% for in-distribution datasets and up to 34\\%\nfor out-of-distribution sentences using statistical language models, while\nlarge language models provided moderate but consistently robust improvement\nacross diverse linguistic contexts. The findings reveal that, while the\nintegration reliably benefits all model sizes, the extent of improvement\nvaries, highlighting the importance of optimized language model parameters.\nFinally, we emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation\nparameters when reporting the results using transformer-based ASR models. In\nsummary, this research clears the way for more inclusive ASR technologies that\nperform better across languages by enriching their linguistic knowledge.

Through rigorous fine-tuning and evaluation across multiple\ndatasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in word error rate,\nparticularly in low-resource scenarios. Our approach not only does take\nadvantage of the extensive data Whisper was pre-trained on, but also\ncomplements its linguistic adaptability by incorporating language models. We\nobtained improvements up to 51\\% for in-distribution datasets and up to 34\\%\nfor out-of-distribution sentences using statistical language models, while\nlarge language models provided moderate but consistently robust improvement\nacross diverse linguistic contexts. The findings reveal that, while the\nintegration reliably benefits all model sizes, the extent of improvement\nvaries, highlighting the importance of optimized language model parameters.\nFinally, we emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation\nparameters when reporting the results using transformer-based ASR models. In\nsummary, this research clears the way for more inclusive ASR technologies that\nperform better across languages by enriching their linguistic knowledge. For\nfurther implementation details of this study, the technical documentation and\nsource code are available at http://www.github.com/hitz-zentroa/whisper-lm.",
