To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first\napproach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and\nrepresentation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing\ncomplexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs.\ngeneration dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which\naligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a\npre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space\ncomplexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both\nreconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic\nregularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using\n1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when\nexpanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize\ntraining for billion-scale tokenizers.

            "summary": "Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can\nsubstantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its\nrule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic\nground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the\nvisual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding\ntasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This\nproperty makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.\nMotivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style\nreinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance\ntheir visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a\ndedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on\ngeneral vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the\nfeasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that\nthe RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual\nunderstanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in\ngeneralization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies\nthat uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward\nhacking in object detection, the emergence of the \"OD aha moment\", the impact\nof training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model\nsizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how\nreinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and\nwe hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued\nprogress in the vision-language RL community.

Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented\nadvances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training\nsuch a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system\nchallenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich\nnormalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training\nprocess of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and\nhigh-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during\npost-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize\n8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on\nmultiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances\nthe state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral\nLarge 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse\nmodel structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates\nthat Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense\nmodels with more than 100 billion parameters. Our model and system will be\navailable for our commercial customers.",

            "summary": "This study presents Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a novel\nencoder-decoder diffusion-based framework for efficient and meaningful\nunsupervised learning in medical imaging, focusing on Alzheimer disease (AD)\nusing brain MR from the ADNI database as a case study. Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework\nfor scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a\nfoundation model for medical image analysis.

        "title": "Latent Diffusion Autoencoders: Toward Efficient and Meaningful\n  Unsupervised Representation Learning in Medical Imaging",
        "summary": "This study presents Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a novel\nencoder-decoder diffusion-based framework for efficient and meaningful\nunsupervised learning in medical imaging, focusing on Alzheimer disease (AD)\nusing brain MR from the ADNI database as a case study. Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework\nfor scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a\nfoundation model for medical image analysis.

In\nthis work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark\nfor 3D graphics editing. BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D\nreconstruction tasks. We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and\nobserve that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks\nrelatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how\ninference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing\ntasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling\nof generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing\nrecent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math\ntasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and\ncan be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and\nverification.",

In\nthis work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark\nfor 3D graphics editing. BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D\nreconstruction tasks. We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and\nobserve that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks\nrelatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how\ninference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing\ntasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling\nof generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing\nrecent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math\ntasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and\ncan be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and\nverification.",
