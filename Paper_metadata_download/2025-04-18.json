For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl\ndo not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets\nsuch as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal\npre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its\nsignificant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,\nwe propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an\nautomated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a\npre-training setting.

When continuously trained on 400B\ntokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art\nLlama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific\ndomain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling.\nFinally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20\nclusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful\n400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers\nsuperior performance under an equal token budget.

            "summary": "Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly\nrelying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and\ncompromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual\ncontrollability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a\nscalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation\ndiffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental\nadvantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse\ncharacter appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity\nresults. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked\ntransformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character\nfeatures and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion\ntransformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a\nlarge-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset\nis systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired\n(text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables\nsimultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability\nthrough distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the\nadvanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity,\ntext-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for\ncharacter-driven image generation.

        "title": "InstantCharacter: Personalize Any Characters with a Scalable Diffusion\n  Transformer Framework",
        "summary": "Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly\nrelying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and\ncompromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual\ncontrollability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a\nscalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation\ndiffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental\nadvantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse\ncharacter appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity\nresults. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked\ntransformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character\nfeatures and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion\ntransformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a\nlarge-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset\nis systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired\n(text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables\nsimultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability\nthrough distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the\nadvanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity,\ntext-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for\ncharacter-driven image generation.

To overcome limitations in character\nidentification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character\nquery banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\nbenchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-eval-Named and our newly\nproposed Cinepile-AD dataset. Code and data will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Thorin215/FocusedAD .",

            "summary": "Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective\ntechniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While\nconcept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based\napproaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting\nsampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods\nrely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is\nbuilt on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free\nguidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content\nmodification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For\nsingle-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map\nto precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly\ncontribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient\nerasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile\nplug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both\nsingle and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without\ncompromising the generative fidelity.

        "title": "Set You Straight: Auto-Steering Denoising Trajectories to Sidestep\n  Unwanted Concepts",
        "summary": "Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective\ntechniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While\nconcept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based\napproaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting\nsampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods\nrely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is\nbuilt on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free\nguidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content\nmodification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For\nsingle-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map\nto precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly\ncontribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient\nerasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile\nplug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both\nsingle and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without\ncompromising the generative fidelity.
