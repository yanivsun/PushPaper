By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus,\ngraph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge\ngraph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current\ngraph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures.\nInadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse\ngraph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded\nperformance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose\nNodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures\nthat enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies\ninto the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this\nframework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance\nadvantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in\nindexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering\nsuperior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended\nhead-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

        "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models to access\nexternal and private corpus, enabling factually consistent responses in\nspecific domains. By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus,\ngraph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge\ngraph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current\ngraph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures.\nInadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse\ngraph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded\nperformance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose\nNodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures\nthat enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies\ninto the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this\nframework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance\nadvantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in\nindexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering\nsuperior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended\nhead-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been\nlimited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces\nCLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with\nHigh-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact\ndilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In\nparticular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects\nof value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work,\nincluding understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as\nwell as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By\nbenchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key\nfindings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet,\nachieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision\nshould be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut\nscenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked\nby human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts,\nindicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments\nalso reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their\nsteerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater\nsteerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective,\ncompared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely\nfrom the first-person framing.",

        "summary": "Navigating high-stakes dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging\neven for humans, let alone for AI. Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been\nlimited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces\nCLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with\nHigh-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact\ndilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In\nparticular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects\nof value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work,\nincluding understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as\nwell as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By\nbenchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key\nfindings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet,\nachieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision\nshould be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut\nscenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked\nby human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts,\nindicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments\nalso reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their\nsteerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater\nsteerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective,\ncompared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely\nfrom the first-person framing.",

            "summary": "Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and\ncomputer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object\ncategories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this\npaper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap\nbetween 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity\nscenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content.

To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment\nframework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed\nframework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response\npairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common\nerror patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal\nunderstanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and\nover-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among\nothers. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred\nand non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference\nOptimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes\nsub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address\nthe limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that\nRRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO.\nOur experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across\ndiverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video\nunderstanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.",

        "summary": "Despite recent advances in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), they still\nstruggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, hallucinate, and often make\nsimple mistakes on even simple video question-answering tasks, all of which\npose significant challenges to their safe and reliable deployment in real-world\napplications. To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment\nframework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed\nframework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response\npairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common\nerror patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal\nunderstanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and\nover-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among\nothers. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred\nand non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference\nOptimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes\nsub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address\nthe limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that\nRRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO.\nOur experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across\ndiverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video\nunderstanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.",
