The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as\nGPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing\ncapabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a\nvast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant\nadvancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large\ngap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in\nthis paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called\nStep1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source\nmodels like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the\nMultimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing\ninstruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a\ndiffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we\nbuild a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For\nevaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world\nuser instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that\nStep1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin\nand approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making\nsignificant contributions to the field of image editing.",

To address\nthis, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the\nnumber of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional\nredundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),\nwhere low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to\nhigh-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key\noperations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel\ndimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which\nuntangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial\narrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy\nrequires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support\nextremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction\nway while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we\npush the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048\nwith gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model\nachieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen\nby 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human\nevaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of\ntext-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance.

We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that\nseamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model\nlow-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level\nsemantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our\nlatent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature\npairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and\ntraining efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard\nDiffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex\ndistillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a\npowerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages\nlearned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both\nconditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial\nimprovements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a\nnew direction for representation-aware generative modeling.",

        "summary": "Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet\nintegrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a\nchallenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that\nseamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model\nlow-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level\nsemantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our\nlatent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature\npairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and\ntraining efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard\nDiffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex\ndistillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a\npowerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages\nlearned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both\nconditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial\nimprovements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a\nnew direction for representation-aware generative modeling.",

We further introduce a\nrobust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact\npropagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and\ngarment movements.

With established methods like t-SNE and PCA\npresenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the\ninterpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear\ntransformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between\nhigh-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear\ntransformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables\ncomplex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability\nadvantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed\nindependently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality\nreduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for\ninterpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for\nidentifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.\nThese tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and\nmodifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the\npractical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software\npackages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and\nindustry.",

        "title": "Interpretable non-linear dimensionality reduction using gaussian\n  weighted linear transformation",
        "summary": "Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and\nvisualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA\npresenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the\ninterpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear\ntransformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between\nhigh-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear\ntransformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables\ncomplex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability\nadvantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed\nindependently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality\nreduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for\ninterpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for\nidentifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.\nThese tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and\nmodifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the\npractical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software\npackages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and\nindustry.",
