CameraBench consists of ~3,000\ndiverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage\nquality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera\nmotion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find,\nfor example, that some motions like \"follow\" (or tracking) require\nunderstanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain\nexpertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For\nexample, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating\nforward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two.\nUsing CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language\nModels (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives\nthat depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric\nprimitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a\ngenerative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase\nits applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question\nanswering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and\ntutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding\ncamera motions in any video.",

To address this\ngap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods\nat varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse\ncollection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural\nlanguage while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even\nmoderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on\nat least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal\nsolution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored\nfor sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold\ntrue beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate\nthat sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer\nLLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of\ntrade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.",

            "summary": "Given a single labeled example, in-context segmentation aims to segment\ncorresponding objects. This setting, known as one-shot segmentation in few-shot\nlearning, explores the segmentation model's generalization ability and has been\napplied to various vision tasks, including scene understanding and image/video\nediting. While recent Segment Anything Models have achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in interactive segmentation, these approaches are not directly\napplicable to in-context segmentation. In this work, we propose the Dual\nConsistency SAM (DC-SAM) method based on prompt-tuning to adapt SAM and SAM2\nfor in-context segmentation of both images and videos. Our key insights are to\nenhance the features of the SAM's prompt encoder in segmentation by providing\nhigh-quality visual prompts.

        "summary": "Given a single labeled example, in-context segmentation aims to segment\ncorresponding objects. This setting, known as one-shot segmentation in few-shot\nlearning, explores the segmentation model's generalization ability and has been\napplied to various vision tasks, including scene understanding and image/video\nediting. While recent Segment Anything Models have achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in interactive segmentation, these approaches are not directly\napplicable to in-context segmentation.
