To address these limitations, we start from an\nnaive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for\ntext rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present\nRepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation\nmodels with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate,\nmultilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really\nunderstand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and\nadditionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to\nenable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text\ncontent, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text\nperceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to\nstabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize\nwith noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region\nmasks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid\ndistortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the\neffectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach\noutperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to\nnative multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also\nexhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.",

Tested\nalone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately, correctly identifying conditions\nin 94.9% of cases and disposition in 56.3% on average. However, participants\nusing the same LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases\nand disposition in less than 44.2%, both no better than the control group. We\nidentify user interactions as a challenge to the deployment of LLMs for medical\nadvice. Standard benchmarks for medical knowledge and simulated patient\ninteractions do not predict the failures we find with human participants.\nMoving forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate\ninteractive capabilities prior to public deployments in healthcare.",

Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and\ncoding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic\nexpertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nin cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously\ncrafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14\nsubdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that\nnecessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank\nincorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct\nalgorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques.\nWe evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and\ncutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results\nreveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose\nchat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current\nreasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption\ntasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and\nmanipulating encrypted data. Through detailed analysis and error\ninvestigations, we provide several key observations that shed light on the\nlimitations and potential improvement areas for LLMs in cryptographic\nreasoning. These findings underscore the need for continuous advancements in\nLLM reasoning capabilities.",

By offline search the\noptimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse\ndistribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU\nkernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates\nseamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or\nfine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA,\nCaptioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art\nlong-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that\nMMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while\nmaintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/MMInference.",

However,\ndisentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL\nCIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed\nfrom classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the\nin-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering\nEnglish sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires\ndeciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL\nCIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,\nproviding a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is\nsmall, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.\nFinally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in\ntheir ability to decode the ciphered inputs.",

However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires\ndeciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL\nCIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,\nproviding a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is\nsmall, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.\nFinally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in\ntheir ability to decode the ciphered inputs.",

This model allows for\ngenerating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3)\nTwo generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies,\ncontribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for\nextensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song\ngeneration tasks using objective and subjective metrics.
