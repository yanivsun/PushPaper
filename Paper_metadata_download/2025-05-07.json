Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner\n(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability\nby using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and\nverify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide\nopen-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without\nexternal data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical\nreasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens\nof thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is\ncompatible with various model classes.",

To this end, we introduce\nScenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene\nplanning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis\nfirst employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it\nby generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture\ninter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces\naccurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like\nobject penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial\ncoherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse,\nrealistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable\nfor virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI\nresearch.",

However, existing methods face several challenges.\nLearning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the\nscene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can\nleverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism,\noften producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense.\nOur key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing\nrealistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce\nScenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene\nplanning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis\nfirst employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it\nby generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture\ninter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces\naccurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like\nobject penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial\ncoherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse,\nrealistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable\nfor virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI\nresearch.",
