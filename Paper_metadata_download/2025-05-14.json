            "summary": "Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires\naligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction\ndata, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once\nvision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the\nmultilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages\nexacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,\nand catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned\nchallenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.\nFirst, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,\ndiverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to\nproduce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many\nlanguages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique\nthat mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only\ncapabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.\nAya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal\nmodels such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger\nLlama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which\noutperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and\nLLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the\nmulti-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively\nbend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.",

        "title": "Aya Vision: Advancing the Frontier of Multilingual Multimodality",
        "summary": "Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires\naligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction\ndata, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once\nvision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the\nmultilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages\nexacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,\nand catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned\nchallenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.\nFirst, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,\ndiverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to\nproduce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many\nlanguages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique\nthat mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only\ncapabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.\nAya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal\nmodels such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger\nLlama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which\noutperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and\nLLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the\nmulti-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively\nbend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.",

In\nthis paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end\nframework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different\nembodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's\nnetwork is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a\ncritic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local\nobservation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the\nprivileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the\ndemonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the\ncritic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our\ndemonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per\nday, 20times more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in\na large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes.\nTrained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on\nquadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian\nSplatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the\nsim-to-real gap.
