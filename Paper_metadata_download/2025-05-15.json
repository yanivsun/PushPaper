Although design choices for image\nunderstanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and\ntraining recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain\nunderexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and\ndiffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis\non image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.\nGrounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a\ndiffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in\ncontrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both\nhigher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first\ntraining on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers\npractical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while\ndeveloping strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a\nhigh-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by\nprompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes,\nobjects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design,\ntraining recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art\nunified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of\nthe popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks.\nTo facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code,\nmodel weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning\ndatasets.",

            "summary": "End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered\nsignificant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken\ndialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This\nis primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual\ninformation which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models\nlike ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback\nmodel based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of\nspoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio\nlanguage models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the\nnonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample\nfeedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized\nevaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a\npreference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both\ncomprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios\nspan various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of\ninstruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios,\nachieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy\nfrom 55.1% to 91.5%. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a\nmargin of 83%. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each\ncomponent of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at\nhttps://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.",

        "title": "WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators",
        "summary": "End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered\nsignificant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken\ndialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This\nis primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual\ninformation which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models\nlike ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback\nmodel based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of\nspoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio\nlanguage models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the\nnonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample\nfeedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized\nevaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a\npreference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both\ncomprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios\nspan various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of\ninstruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios,\nachieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy\nfrom 55.1% to 91.5%. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a\nmargin of 83%. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each\ncomponent of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at\nhttps://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.",

We create VCRBench using procedural videos of\nsimple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each\nclip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason\nabout, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal.\nMoreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting\nlinguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while\nalso avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models\nstruggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their\ndifficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual\nobservations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose\nRecognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks\nvideo-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal\nreasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts\naccuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%.

This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person\ndataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world\nconditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million\nbounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from\nthree continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More\nimportant, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two\nsessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location,\nmaking it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were\nannotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection,\ntracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence\nof DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and\nReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in\ndetection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs\nconditions.

By representing scenes as a\nmixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for\nefficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture\nfine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional\npoints. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting\nin excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands\n- posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies\nand improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is\ncrucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach,\nwe establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal\nnumber of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction,\nand provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building\non these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density\ncontrol, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact\npoint cloud.
