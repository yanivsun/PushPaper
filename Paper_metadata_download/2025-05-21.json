Nevertheless, the potential of\nreasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in\nthe context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on\nvisual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a\nreasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with\nreinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the\nintrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of\nimages, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple\nquality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute\ncomparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other\nunder the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using\ncontinuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms\ndiscriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent\nreasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is\ncapable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions,\nand supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale\nrealignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for\nreliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like\nsuper-resolution and image generation.",

We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT)\nwith two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'\nagentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nVisual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and\n+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT\nalso achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks\nsuch as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.\nOur findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building\nrobust and generalizable multimodal agents.",

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but\nalso in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six\nreasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better\nconfidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the\n36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem\nfrom the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring\nalternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their\nconfidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more\naccurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly\nbetter calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning\nmodels. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a\nsignificant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not\nexclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to\nperform slow thinking via in-context learning.",

        "summary": "Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to\ncommunicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when\nthey might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but\nalso in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six\nreasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better\nconfidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the\n36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem\nfrom the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring\nalternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their\nconfidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more\naccurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly\nbetter calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning\nmodels. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a\nsignificant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not\nexclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to\nperform slow thinking via in-context learning.",

VideoEval-Pro assesses both\nsegment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning\ntasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the\nfollowing findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance (>25\\%) drops on\nopen-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do\nnot lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other\nMCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input\nframes.

There is concerning preliminary evidence\nthat models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To\nexplore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we\ntrain a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word\nwithout explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to\nthe model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to\nuncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box)\napproaches.

        "summary": "As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that\nthey remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence\nthat models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To\nexplore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we\ntrain a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word\nwithout explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to\nthe model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to\nuncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box)\napproaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on\nmechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse\nautoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting\nthe secret word in our proof-of-concept setting.

However, its impact\non model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and\nsystematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the\nhallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce\nhallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate\nthis, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of\nunanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an\nunanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous\ninformation. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model\nrefusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency\nto hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during\nRFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy\ntrade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage\ninference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge\nboundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems\nbut also to factual question answering tasks.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has become a standard approach for enhancing\nthe reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its impact\non model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and\nsystematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the\nhallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce\nhallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate\nthis, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of\nunanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an\nunanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous\ninformation. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model\nrefusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency\nto hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during\nRFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy\ntrade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage\ninference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge\nboundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems\nbut also to factual question answering tasks.",

Numerous benchmark\ndatasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these\nmodels, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution\ntasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a\ndistinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term\nsupport (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset\nand its subset selected with 5,102 and 300 repositories respectively.\nSelected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty,\noffering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code\nmigration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to\nfacilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging\ntask. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively\ntackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate\n(pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset\nand source code are available at:\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and\nhttps://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.",

Numerous benchmark\ndatasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these\nmodels, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution\ntasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a\ndistinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term\nsupport (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset\nand its subset selected with 5,102 and 300 repositories respectively.\nSelected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty,\noffering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code\nmigration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to\nfacilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging\ntask. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively\ntackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate\n(pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset\nand source code are available at:\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and\nhttps://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.",

The\nsubsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further\ncomplicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off:\nsophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally\nprohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster\nmethods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nFlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational\nresources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking\nusing a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose\nthe Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework\nthat intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution\ncompletion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver\nfeedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing\nerrors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full\napproach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and\ninference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to\nenhance LLM reasoning at test time.",

        "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a\ntrade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The\nsubsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further\ncomplicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off:\nsophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally\nprohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster\nmethods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nFlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational\nresources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking\nusing a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose\nthe Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework\nthat intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution\ncompletion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver\nfeedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing\nerrors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full\napproach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and\ninference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to\nenhance LLM reasoning at test time.",

When Language Models (LMs) are prompted\nwith multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant\ninformation but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information\nsources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the\ncausal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In\nthis paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting\nsearch results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study\nreveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the\nones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in\nMHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order\nof gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned\ndecoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order\naligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models\nwith bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively\nboost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of\nMHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher\nvalues when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to\nheuristically improve LMs' performance on this task.

While existing methods rely on\nglobal or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and\nirrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In\nthis work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured\nalternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities,\nintroducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks.\nWe benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense\nmethods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging\nfrom simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual\nconditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of\ndistractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and\nglobal representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific\npretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for\ndesigning visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world\nrobotic environments.",

        "title": "Object-Centric Representations Improve Policy Generalization in Robot\n  Manipulation",
        "summary": "Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization\ncapabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on\nglobal or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and\nirrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In\nthis work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured\nalternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities,\nintroducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks.\nWe benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense\nmethods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging\nfrom simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual\nconditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of\ndistractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and\nglobal representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific\npretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for\ndesigning visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world\nrobotic environments.",
