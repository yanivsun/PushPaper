While large-scale LLMs have shown\nimpressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine\ntranslation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim\nbased on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.\nDespite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several\nestablished benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training\napproach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental\nresults show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while\nsignificantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also\nintroduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in\nexisting Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short\nsentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000\nexpert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a\nmore comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in\nTarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like\nGPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and\nadvance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.",

This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity\nleads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods\nattempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to\nhandle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained\nsolution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nreasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),\nwhich enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the\ndifficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)\nwith Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty\nmechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This\nstudy emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning\nstrategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for\nLLMs.",

        "summary": "Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning\nstrategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their\ndifficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity\nleads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods\nattempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to\nhandle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained\nsolution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nreasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),\nwhich enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the\ndifficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)\nwith Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty\nmechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This\nstudy emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning\nstrategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for\nLLMs.",

Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the\nunit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be\nexplicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces\nMulti-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of\nexplicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,\nthe model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces\na thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer.

However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to\ninefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel\ntraining paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs\nto interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that\nmodels inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which\ncan be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective\nrule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the\npolicy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals\ngenerated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across\nfive diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)\ndemonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,\nwithout requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by\nover 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,\nour method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning\ndatasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets\nsuch as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to\nreveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.",

        "summary": "Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models'\n(LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to\ninefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel\ntraining paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs\nto interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that\nmodels inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which\ncan be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective\nrule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the\npolicy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals\ngenerated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across\nfive diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)\ndemonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,\nwithout requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by\nover 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,\nour method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning\ndatasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets\nsuch as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to\nreveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.",

We propose the coverage principle: a\ndata-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern\nmatching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting\nfragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We\ndemonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the\ngeneralization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically\nconfirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at\nleast quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency\ndoes not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks\nwith path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple\ncomputational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state\nrepresentations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,\nChain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop\ntasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a\nmechanism-based taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks\ncan generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based\n(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function\nreuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where\nnew architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.\nOverall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding\ncompositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural\nor training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.",

        "summary": "Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in\nsystematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a\ndata-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern\nmatching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting\nfragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We\ndemonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the\ngeneralization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically\nconfirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at\nleast quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency\ndoes not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks\nwith path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple\ncomputational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state\nrepresentations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,\nChain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop\ntasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a\nmechanism-based taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks\ncan generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based\n(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function\nreuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where\nnew architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.\nOverall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding\ncompositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural\nor training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.",

Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF)\noffers a more direct alternative by framing the problem as finding a Nash\nequilibrium of a game defined by these preferences. In this work, we introduce\nNash Mirror Prox (Nash-MP), an online NLHF algorithm that leverages\nthe Mirror Prox optimization scheme to achieve fast and stable convergence to\nthe Nash equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis establishes that Nash-MP\nexhibits last-iterate linear convergence towards the beta-regularized Nash\nequilibrium. Specifically, we prove that the KL-divergence to the optimal\npolicy decreases at a rate of order (1+2beta)^{-N/2}, where N is a number\nof preference queries. We further demonstrate last-iterate linear convergence\nfor the exploitability gap and uniformly for the span semi-norm of\nlog-probabilities, with all these rates being independent of the size of the\naction space. Furthermore, we propose and analyze an approximate version of\nNash-MP where proximal steps are estimated using stochastic policy gradients,\nmaking the algorithm closer to applications. Finally, we detail a practical\nimplementation strategy for fine-tuning large language models and present\nexperiments that demonstrate its competitive performance and compatibility with\nexisting methods.",

Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are\ncomputationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent\nmachine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity;\nyet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and\nlack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a\nnovel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and\ngenerative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation\nand high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical\nnumerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is\ntrained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force\nfields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance\nacross diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions,\nachieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while\nenabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a\nsignificant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible\nfluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release\nboth models and data upon acceptance.",

        "title": "Hybrid Neural-MPM for Interactive Fluid Simulations in Real-Time",
        "summary": "We propose a neural physics system for real-time, interactive fluid\nsimulations. Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are\ncomputationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent\nmachine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity;\nyet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and\nlack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a\nnovel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and\ngenerative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation\nand high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical\nnumerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is\ntrained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force\nfields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance\nacross diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions,\nachieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while\nenabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a\nsignificant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible\nfluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release\nboth models and data upon acceptance.",

Existing methods, constrained by\ninsufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit\nlimited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex\nconnectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce\nGLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active\nmapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets.\nBuilding upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable\nexploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes\nmainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and\nrandomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved\nmapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

        "summary": "Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a\ncritical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by\ninsufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit\nlimited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex\nconnectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce\nGLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active\nmapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets.\nBuilding upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable\nexploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes\nmainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and\nrandomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved\nmapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

            "summary": "An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and\nHarmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.\nHowever, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually\ntakes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens.

        "summary": "An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and\nHarmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.\nHowever, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually\ntakes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone.

We release\nFLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven\ndecoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose\narchitecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely\nreflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs,\nand checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation.\nAcross six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4\npoints over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full\ntraining trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i)\nexperts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation\nmatrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing\nbehavior stabilizes early in training.

        "summary": "Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4\nincreasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong\nefficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model\nper token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE\nplatform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release\nFLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven\ndecoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose\narchitecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely\nreflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs,\nand checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation.\nAcross six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4\npoints over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full\ntraining trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i)\nexperts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation\nmatrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing\nbehavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model\ncheckpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.",

We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive\nMulti-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing\n4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images\nacross 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.\nMMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level\nmetrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel\nAspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers\nfine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human\njudgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.\nUsing MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5\nPro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human\nratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will\nrelease the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation\nand accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.",

        "title": "MMIG-Bench: Towards Comprehensive and Explainable Evaluation of\n  Multi-Modal Image Generation Models",
        "summary": "Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and\nGemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and\nmaintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint\ntoolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning,\nand customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional\nsemantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive\nMulti-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing\n4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images\nacross 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.\nMMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level\nmetrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel\nAspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers\nfine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human\njudgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.\nUsing MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5\nPro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human\nratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will\nrelease the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation\nand accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.",
