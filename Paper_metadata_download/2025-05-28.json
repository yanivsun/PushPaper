            "summary": "Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision\nmaking in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications,\nrequires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from\nclosed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the\nfirst medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through\nreinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public\nmultiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data.\nAlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks,\noutperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging\nbenchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source\nmodels such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the\nfactors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis\nguided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize\nreasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and\ndiversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the\nemergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset\ninformativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist\nRL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning\nwithout CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks,\nunderscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more\nchallenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision\nmaking in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications,\nrequires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from\nclosed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the\nfirst medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through\nreinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public\nmultiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data.\nAlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks,\noutperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging\nbenchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source\nmodels such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the\nfactors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis\nguided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize\nreasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and\ndiversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the\nemergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset\ninformativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist\nRL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning\nwithout CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks,\nunderscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more\nchallenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.",

Out-of-distribution detection identifies\nwhether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world\nrecognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as\never-emerging, previously unknown categories appear and must be addressed\nwithout retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on\nlarge and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across\ndomains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test\nsets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation\nback to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel\nconditions encountered in clinical use.\n  We therefore present NOVA, a challenging, real-life evaluation-only\nbenchmark of sim900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and\nheterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical\nnarratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations.

        "summary": "In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ\nfrom the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies\nwhether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world\nrecognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as\never-emerging, previously unknown categories appear and must be addressed\nwithout retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on\nlarge and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across\ndomains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test\nsets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation\nback to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel\nconditions encountered in clinical use.\n  We therefore present NOVA, a challenging, real-life evaluation-only\nbenchmark of sim900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and\nheterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical\nnarratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these\nenable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and\ndiagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an\nextreme stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge\na distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space.

            "summary": "The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has\nled to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,\nthis methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is\npossible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,\nhealthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current\npractical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,\nthis introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,\nsusceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the\nverifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a\nverifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead\nuses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference\nanswer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,\nin addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute\nrequirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on\nextensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple\nperspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and\nimplicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization\napproach.

        "summary": "The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has\nled to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,\nthis methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is\npossible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,\nhealthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current\npractical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,\nthis introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,\nsusceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the\nverifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a\nverifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead\nuses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference\nanswer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,\nin addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute\nrequirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on\nextensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple\nperspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and\nimplicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization\napproach.

To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,\na precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and\nmotion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target\nmotion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively.

Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our\nregion-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly\nutilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing\nfine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the\npredicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement\nregions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video\ndenoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask\nthrough feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a\nbenchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for\nthe evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.\nExtensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the\neffectiveness of MotionPro.

We introduce MMPerspective, the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding\nof perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary\ndimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark\ncomprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083\nquestion-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point\nperception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship\nunderstanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving\ntransformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art\nMLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence\non surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning\nand maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further\nreveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective\ncapabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of\nchain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for\ndiagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.\nResources available at: https://yunlong10.github.io/MMPerspective/",

In this paper, we propose\nAdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the\ninternet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's\nenvironment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat\nmodel than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content\nconstraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes\nstrategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into\nclicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers\npotential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these\nintents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the\nagent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60%\nin most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly\ndemonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and\nreal-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents.

Recently, in the multimodal\ndomain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form\nreasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks\nshare an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely\non the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such\nfree-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1)\nExtended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions,\ndegrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify\npolicy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these\nissues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI (Spatially\nAnchored Task Optimization with\nReInforcement Learning), which decomposes VQA into three\nverifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and\nanswer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and\nbounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent\nperformance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to 15.7%\nimprovement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our\nanalysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions,\nwhich brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/justairr/SATORI-R1.",

While this design simplifies training for earlier\ngeneration models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and\nhinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion\nrepresentation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned\nalternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global\nspace. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this\nformulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text\nalignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and\nno auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally\nsupports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and\ntemporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and\ncostly classifier guidance generation from control signals.

        "summary": "State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the\nkinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D,\nwhich encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with\nbuilt-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier\ngeneration models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and\nhinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion\nrepresentation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned\nalternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global\nspace. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this\nformulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text\nalignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and\nno auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally\nsupports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and\ntemporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and\ncostly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we\ndemonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices\nin motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and\nmotion-related applications.",

To improve\ndiagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for\nthe automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong\npredictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their\nopaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates\ntwo core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a\nmodular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual\nradiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between\nFrontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based\non the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and\nexplainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic\nreasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or\ndistillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of\nstructured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike\npost-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,\nour framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference\nprocess-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the\nmodel's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the\ndiagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering\nrationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.",
