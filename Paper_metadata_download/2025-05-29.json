To\nfurther accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction\nof FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8\nMatmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++\nachieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same\nattention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively\naccelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video\ngeneration, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss.

        "summary": "The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows\nquadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing\nquantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To\nfurther accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction\nof FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8\nMatmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++\nachieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same\nattention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively\naccelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video\ngeneration, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available\nat https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.",

Experimental results on\nmathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR\nsignificantly outperforms existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the\nLlama3.2 model. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong\ngeneralization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide\nmuch larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust\nsolution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core\ncapabilities.

            "summary": "Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human\nreasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,\nand concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn\nto reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In\nthis work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such\nabstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We\npresent a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in\nsentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next\nsentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical\nrepresentation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to\npreserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via\nnext-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both\nunder two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted\nembedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely\nin embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,\nlogic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous\ninference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while\nreducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs\nof scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent\ntrajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes\nintermediate model states into interpretable sentences.

        "summary": "Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human\nreasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,\nand concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn\nto reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In\nthis work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such\nabstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We\npresent a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in\nsentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next\nsentences.

As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model\nreasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex\nreasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact\nwith search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning\ntrajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual\noptimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of\nRL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely\nincorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token\nallocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models\ninteract with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant\ninformation due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space\ntailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling,\nallowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the\nretriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query\nrewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward.

            "summary": "Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that\nmask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and\nopaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through\nprompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model\nparameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm\nthat turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human\n(or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the\nrelevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward\nsignals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending\nportions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned\nadjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three\ncomponents: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs\ncritiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts\nspan-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a\nspan-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.\nAcross summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad\nconsistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing\nboth higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate\nthat natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful\nsignal for fine-grained policy optimization.

        "title": "Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback",
        "summary": "Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that\nmask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and\nopaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through\nprompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model\nparameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm\nthat turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human\n(or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the\nrelevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward\nsignals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending\nportions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned\nadjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three\ncomponents: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs\ncritiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts\nspan-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a\nspan-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.\nAcross summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad\nconsistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing\nboth higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate\nthat natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful\nsignal for fine-grained policy optimization.

To reduce costs, a potential\npromising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language\nmodel before transferring it to the large one. We construct small \"surrogate\nmodels\" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the\nlarge target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders\ntrained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model,\na process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the\nfull-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair\nand, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with\nthe target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall\nVLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.",

        "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder\nwith a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the\nprimary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential\npromising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language\nmodel before transferring it to the large one. We construct small \"surrogate\nmodels\" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the\nlarge target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders\ntrained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model,\na process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the\nfull-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair\nand, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with\nthe target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall\nVLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.",

This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,\nmathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order\ninformation to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's\ninfluence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights\nthat are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward\nstrong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for\nboth Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce\ncomputational cost, we propose a landmark-based approximation:\ninfluence is precisely computed for a small subset of \"landmark\" samples and\nthen efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We\nvalidate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the\nTulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,\nacross several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that\nInfluence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance\nwhile achieving up to 3.5times faster selection.",

        "title": "Efficient Data Selection at Scale via Influence Distillation",
        "summary": "Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,\nmathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order\ninformation to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's\ninfluence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights\nthat are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward\nstrong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for\nboth Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce\ncomputational cost, we propose a landmark-based approximation:\ninfluence is precisely computed for a small subset of \"landmark\" samples and\nthen efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We\nvalidate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the\nTulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,\nacross several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that\nInfluence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance\nwhile achieving up to 3.5times faster selection.",

Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance\nis closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover\ncontent, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching\nmechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each\nassigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the\noptimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion\nof watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet\ntransform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local\nscanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during\nwatermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues\nfor efficient and robust watermark protection.

To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).",

To advance research on the\nfluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed\nto evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the\nreasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the\naccuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric,\nminimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging\nmodels to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than\nlearned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500\nvisual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**.\nUnlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer,\nwe evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations\nand the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the\nfinal prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are\nsubstantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as\n`o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest\naverage accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all\nmodels struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting\nsignificant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms\nof reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet`\nachieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively.

        "summary": "Although large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance in a wide range of multimodal tasks, their true reasoning\ncapabilities on human IQ tests remain underexplored. To advance research on the\nfluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed\nto evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the\nreasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the\naccuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric,\nminimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging\nmodels to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than\nlearned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500\nvisual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**.\nUnlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer,\nwe evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations\nand the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the\nfinal prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are\nsubstantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as\n`o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest\naverage accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all\nmodels struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting\nsignificant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms\nof reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet`\nachieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively. These results\nhighlight inconsistencies between the reasoning processes of the models and\ntheir final answers, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of\nthe reasoning in addition to the final predictions.",
