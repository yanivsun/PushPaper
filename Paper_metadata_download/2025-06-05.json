In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning.

Our further analysis indicates some\ndesign choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual\nnon-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering\nthem vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also\nreveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding\nto accommodate extended context lengths.

However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus\non understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in\nthe question (hereafter referred to as \"question frame\") and perceive a few\nadjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for\nMultimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the\nfollowing features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required\nto infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.\n(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception\nalone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks\nare manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to\nalign with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor\nannotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos\nand 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with\nmulti-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only\n52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies\n(Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further\nanalysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from\nit in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains.\nWe hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal\nreasoning capabilities.",

Through our experiments, we\ndiscover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to\nparameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel\nmethod for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal\nanalysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut\nneuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our\nevaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently\nreleased trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient (rho)\nexceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals\ntrue capabilities of the models and is trustworthy.

While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects\nfrom text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes\nremains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a\nnovel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud\nsequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing\napproaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction\nwith inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D\nreconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo).\nOur method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video\nDiffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth\nvideo sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global\ncoherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point\nculling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for\niterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data\nEngine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation\nand metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse\ntraining data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these\ndesigns result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality\nand geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.",

        "title": "Voyager: Long-Range and World-Consistent Video Diffusion for Explorable\n  3D Scene Generation",
        "summary": "Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand\nthe ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera\ntrajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects\nfrom text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes\nremains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a\nnovel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud\nsequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing\napproaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction\nwith inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D\nreconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo).\nOur method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video\nDiffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth\nvideo sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global\ncoherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point\nculling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for\niterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data\nEngine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation\nand metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse\ntraining data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these\ndesigns result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality\nand geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.",

Inference-time reward alignment with score-based\ngenerative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader\nparadigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of\nthis trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising\nprocess. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the\nGaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results\nin reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the\nreward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable\nposterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the\npreconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines\ndimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach\nenables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves\nperformance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image\ngeneration, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as\ndemonstrated in our experiments.",

To obtain training\ndata, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated\nfrom independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained\ncomparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion\nclips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce\nDenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three\ncontributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted\ncopies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar\nmotion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing\nthe motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label\npreferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and\nmore precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO\ngreatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text\nalignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that\nDenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences\nsimilar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO\ntrained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.",

This results in aligned pairs with similar\nmotion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing\nthe motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label\npreferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and\nmore precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO\ngreatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text\nalignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that\nDenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences\nsimilar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO\ntrained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.",

To fill these gaps, we present\n\\benchname{}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate\nLLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks,\nOrak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling\ncomprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for\nintricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we\nintroduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that\nenables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules.\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay\ntrajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and\nin-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning\neffects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

        "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry,\nparticularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters.\nHowever, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack\nevaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of\nagentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for\naligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present\n\\benchname{}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate\nLLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks,\nOrak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling\ncomprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for\nintricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we\nintroduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that\nenables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules.\nAdditionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay\ntrajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and\nin-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning\neffects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

            "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such\nas scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify\nthree key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:\nperformance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent\nfailures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting\nperformance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed\nproblems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that\nintegrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy\noptimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nExtensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that\nCritique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based\nfine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general\nreasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,\nrespectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that\nincorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals\ntwo critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not\nalways guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses\ndo not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such\nas scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify\nthree key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:\nperformance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent\nfailures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting\nperformance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed\nproblems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that\nintegrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy\noptimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nExtensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that\nCritique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based\nfine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general\nreasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,\nrespectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that\nincorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals\ntwo critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not\nalways guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses\ndo not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.",

            "summary": "Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by\nusing a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model\nto verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of\nthe target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy.

This leads to compromised reliability for automated\nflowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and\nengineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which\ntraces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.\nFlowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves\nexplainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We\npropose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post\nhoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,\nthen converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic\napproach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.\nAdditionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating\nflowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.\nExperimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in\nLLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our\nproposed FlowExplainBench dataset.",

        "title": "Follow the Flow: Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution with Neurosymbolic\n  Agents",
        "summary": "Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes.\nHowever, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships\nmake it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models\nfrequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when\nanalyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated\nflowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and\nengineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which\ntraces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.\nFlowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves\nexplainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We\npropose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post\nhoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,\nthen converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic\napproach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.\nAdditionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating\nflowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.\nExperimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in\nLLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our\nproposed FlowExplainBench dataset.",

We argue that a robust object referring model\nshould be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and\nfaithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key\nproperties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies\nits predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,\nby learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given\nexpression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box\nprediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject\nexpressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a\nmodel that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given\na referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances\ncorresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs\nstep-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the\ngiven expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,\nwe construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by\nprompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a\nstructured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to\nlearn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train\nRex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach\nthe model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL\nlearning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our\napproach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability\non in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject\nhallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.",

            "summary": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively\nusing reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing\napproaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:\nToken-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage\nsignals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training\nan accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,\nGRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,\nleading to imprecise credit assignment.

        "summary": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively\nusing reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing\napproaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:\nToken-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage\nsignals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training\nan accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,\nGRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,\nleading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we\npropose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages\nsegment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a\nbetter balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level\nmethods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,\nenabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a\ncritic model.

Active Learning (AL) is an\nestablished method that minimizes human labeling effort by iteratively\nselecting the most informative unlabeled samples for expert annotation, thereby\nimproving the overall classification performance. Even though AL has been known\nfor decades, AL is still rarely used in real-world applications. As indicated\nin the two community web surveys among the NLP community about AL, two main\nreasons continue to hold practitioners back from using AL: first, the\ncomplexity of setting AL up, and second, a lack of trust in its effectiveness.\nWe hypothesize that both reasons share the same culprit: the large\nhyperparameter space of AL. This mostly unexplored hyperparameter space often\nleads to misleading and irreproducible AL experiment results. In this study, we\nfirst compiled a large hyperparameter grid of over 4.6 million hyperparameter\ncombinations, second, recorded the performance of all combinations in the\nso-far biggest conducted AL study, and third, analyzed the impact of each\nhyperparameter in the experiment results. In the end, we give recommendations\nabout the influence of each hyperparameter, demonstrate the surprising\ninfluence of the concrete AL strategy implementation, and outline an\nexperimental study design for reproducible AL experiments with minimal\ncomputational effort, thus contributing to more reproducible and trustworthy AL\nresearch in the future.",

Active Learning (AL) is an\nestablished method that minimizes human labeling effort by iteratively\nselecting the most informative unlabeled samples for expert annotation, thereby\nimproving the overall classification performance. Even though AL has been known\nfor decades, AL is still rarely used in real-world applications. As indicated\nin the two community web surveys among the NLP community about AL, two main\nreasons continue to hold practitioners back from using AL: first, the\ncomplexity of setting AL up, and second, a lack of trust in its effectiveness.\nWe hypothesize that both reasons share the same culprit: the large\nhyperparameter space of AL. This mostly unexplored hyperparameter space often\nleads to misleading and irreproducible AL experiment results. In this study, we\nfirst compiled a large hyperparameter grid of over 4.6 million hyperparameter\ncombinations, second, recorded the performance of all combinations in the\nso-far biggest conducted AL study, and third, analyzed the impact of each\nhyperparameter in the experiment results. In the end, we give recommendations\nabout the influence of each hyperparameter, demonstrate the surprising\ninfluence of the concrete AL strategy implementation, and outline an\nexperimental study design for reproducible AL experiments with minimal\ncomputational effort, thus contributing to more reproducible and trustworthy AL\nresearch in the future.",

Their impressive performance suggests that these\nmodels should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but\nthat approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key\nobstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the\nunderlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is\nusually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover\nrare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training\nfree variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a\nprior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective\nfor flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it\nwith deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce\nexact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the\ndata fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent\ncalibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated\naccording to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging\nbenchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-\nand flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.",

        "summary": "Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to\ngenerate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic\ntext-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these\nmodels should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but\nthat approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key\nobstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the\nunderlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is\nusually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover\nrare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training\nfree variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a\nprior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective\nfor flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it\nwith deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce\nexact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the\ndata fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent\ncalibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated\naccording to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging\nbenchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-\nand flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.",
