Despite recent advancements, existing models,\nespecially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to\ngeneralize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve\nstrong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of\nextending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,\nwhere an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and\nlanguage data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does\nmodality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging\neffectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to\nachieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better\nknowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through\nextensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into\nthe feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.",

        "title": "Is Extending Modality The Right Path Towards Omni-Modality?",
        "summary": "Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse\ninput modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining\nstrong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models,\nespecially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to\ngeneralize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve\nstrong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of\nextending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,\nwhere an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and\nlanguage data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does\nmodality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging\neffectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to\nachieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better\nknowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through\nextensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into\nthe feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.",

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in\nisolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In\ncontrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs)\nintroduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across\nthe entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents\nautonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and\nmanual coordination.
