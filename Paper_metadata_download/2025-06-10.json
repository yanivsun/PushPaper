RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast\namounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on\ndomain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of\nnext-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy\nof predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained\nfoundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that\nincreased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction\naccuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling\nparadigm to advance language model pre-training.",

However, rapid T2I model\nadvancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive\nevaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and\nstyle. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge\nmodeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems\nrequiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not\nadequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we\nintroduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark\nframework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,\nincluding prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated\ncontent, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this\nbenchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers\nand practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of\nimage generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by\nallowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of\ngenerating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only\nfor the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the\ncorresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly\navailable to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model\ncomparisons within the T2I research community.",

        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating\nhigh-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model\nadvancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive\nevaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and\nstyle. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge\nmodeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems\nrequiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not\nadequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we\nintroduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark\nframework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,\nincluding prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated\ncontent, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this\nbenchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers\nand practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of\nimage generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by\nallowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of\ngenerating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only\nfor the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the\ncorresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly\navailable to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model\ncomparisons within the T2I research community.",

            "summary": "Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing\nchemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable\nformats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in\nthis task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex\nmolecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) the Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought\nmechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular\ngraphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric\nprinciple of Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen, which addresses\nthe mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded\nannotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a\nlarge-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,\nand introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained\nevaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist\nmodels, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in\nscenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,\nGTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage\npoints, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work\nwill drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby\nadvancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release\nGTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.",

        "title": "GTR-CoT: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought for Molecular\n  Structure Recognition",
        "summary": "Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing\nchemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable\nformats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in\nthis task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex\nmolecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) the Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought\nmechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular\ngraphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric\nprinciple of Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen, which addresses\nthe mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded\nannotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a\nlarge-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,\nand introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained\nevaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist\nmodels, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in\nscenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,\nGTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage\npoints, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work\nwill drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby\nadvancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release\nGTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.",

CCI4.0\noccupies roughly 35 TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:\nCCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a 5.2 TB carefully\ncurated Chinese web corpus, a 22.5 TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and\ndiverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are\nmostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various\ndomains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to\nprocess. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based\non models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and\ndomain-aware fluency filtering. We extract 4.5 billion pieces of\nCoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the\ndistillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction\nexemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the\npossibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs\npre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,\nyielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and\ncode reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous\ndata curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,\nshedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.",

        "summary": "We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered\nfor superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0\noccupies roughly 35 TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:\nCCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a 5.2 TB carefully\ncurated Chinese web corpus, a 22.5 TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and\ndiverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are\nmostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various\ndomains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to\nprocess. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based\non models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and\ndomain-aware fluency filtering. We extract 4.5 billion pieces of\nCoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the\ndistillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction\nexemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the\npossibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs\npre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,\nyielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and\ncode reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous\ndata curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,\nshedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.",

However, existing\nGUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,\nthus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates\nself-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal\nGUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,\noffline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.\nGUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated\ndata generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.\nSpecifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically\nconstruct reflection and error correction data from existing successful\ntrajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI\nunderstanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and\nevaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a\ndiverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of\nGUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection\ntuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to\ncontinuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our\nframework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,\npaving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with\nall data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in\nrevolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing\nGUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,\nthus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates\nself-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal\nGUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,\noffline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.\nGUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated\ndata generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.\nSpecifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically\nconstruct reflection and error correction data from existing successful\ntrajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI\nunderstanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and\nevaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a\ndiverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of\nGUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection\ntuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to\ncontinuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our\nframework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,\npaving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with\nall data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.",

Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on\ntasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is\nconsistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)\nmodels are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when\ninstructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases\nreliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of\nmodel-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge\nconflict in the deployment of LLMs.",

In addition to dynamic benchmark\nconstruction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic\nenvironment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness,\nsafety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative\napplications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior\nthat static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM\nevaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric\ndomains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world\ndeployment readiness. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Froot-NetSys/NetPress.",

Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes\nmodels using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands.\nHowever, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is\nfrequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose gamma-PO, a\ndynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward\nmargins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin\ncalibration, gamma-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those\ndemonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from\nambiguous pairs. Moreover, gamma-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible\nwith variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs.\nAcross benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, gamma-PO achieves an\naverage 4.4\\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for\nstate-of-the-art performance. Additionally, gamma-PO requires minimal code\nchanges and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust\nsolution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

        "summary": "The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their\nsafety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes\nmodels using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands.\nHowever, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is\nfrequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose gamma-PO, a\ndynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward\nmargins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin\ncalibration, gamma-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those\ndemonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from\nambiguous pairs. Moreover, gamma-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible\nwith variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs.\nAcross benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, gamma-PO achieves an\naverage 4.4\\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for\nstate-of-the-art performance. Additionally, gamma-PO requires minimal code\nchanges and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust\nsolution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

To address\nthese limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key\ncontributions.
