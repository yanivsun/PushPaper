            "summary": "Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,\npreventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores\nadversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.\nThis not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for\none-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables\ntraining the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in\nreducing error accumulation during long video generation.

In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame.

ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT\nfine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)\nreinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a\nfine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural\nintegrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter\nmodel achieves a 97\\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,\nnode-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior\nstate-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as\nGPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the\nreasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.\nQualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows\nwith diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art\ncreation.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure\ndetector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature\nspace and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task\nsuccess and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this\ninsight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a\nsingle scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on\nboth successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is\ncompatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, pi_0,\nand pi_0-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively.

To this end, we introduce a novel and\ntraining-free method called Internal Confidence, which leverages\nself-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA\nand mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can\noutperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method\ncan be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce\ninference costs while maintaining performance.",
