However, existing\ndiffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image\nrestoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in\ndegraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect\ntext-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In\nthis paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel\nrestoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and\ntextual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale\nbenchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and\ncomplex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion\nframework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion\nmodels into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from\njoint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,\nwhich are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text\nrecognition accuracy.

It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration\nof 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering\npairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via\na multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to\nprioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that\ngenerates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally\ngrounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit\ninference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses\nmodels at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the\nfinal results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to\nevaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions\ncomprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on\nVRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that\nadvance the field of multi-step reasoning.",

As interest in token-based audio processing\ngrows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have\nreviewed the latest progress in the field.

This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete\naudio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We\npropose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,\nquantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application\ndomains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,\ndownstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs\nthrough controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,\npractical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance\nfor future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract\ntokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE\narchitecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This\ndesign enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs\nwithin a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without\nrequiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.\nImportantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by\nsupporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration\nof an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for\nhigh-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in\ncontext-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct\nversatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a\npowerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.\nNotably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of\nto match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights\nto encourage further research and development in the community.",

We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for\nChinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and\nis constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further\nyields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist\nLLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a\nknowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge\nrules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller\nmodels to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and\ndata are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.",

            "summary": "A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the\nright units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain\ntheir outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner.

        "summary": "A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the\nright units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain\ntheir outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model.

We propose a novel\nframework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to\nmore accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we\nintroduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which\nleverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair\nfor more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft\nmodel's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt\ntokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft\nmodels for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility\nbeyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the\nattention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on\nlong-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher\naccuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in\nmemory usage, latency, and throughput.

Specifically, we\nintroduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which\nleverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair\nfor more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft\nmodel's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt\ntokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft\nmodels for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility\nbeyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the\nattention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on\nlong-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher\naccuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in\nmemory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.",

However, existing methods\nstruggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated\ninputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)\nmaintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms\nuncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering\nscene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical\ninnovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS\nposition prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic\ndecoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat\nconsistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic\nscene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily\nlong video streams.
