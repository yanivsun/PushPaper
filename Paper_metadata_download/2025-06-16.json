However, they are\ntypically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In\nthis work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:\nUniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian\ndiffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian\ndiffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a\ncurriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training\nspeed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass\nautoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we\npresent Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency\ndistillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm\nunlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating\nsampling by two orders of magnitude.

        "summary": "Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text\ngeneration due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are\ntypically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In\nthis work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:\nUniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian\ndiffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian\ndiffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a\ncurriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training\nspeed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass\nautoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we\npresent Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency\ndistillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm\nunlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating\nsampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints\non the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo",

However, extending this\nsuccess to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded\nby the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and\nunambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption\nHallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,\nsynthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image\ncaptions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual\ndescription error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or\nspatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the\nimage and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual\ndifficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute\nand unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains\nacross a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond\nnatural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,\nshowing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen\nobjects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a\ncategory-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception\nerrors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results\ndemonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and\ngeneralizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.",

Drawing on knowledge from a group of\nmedalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,\nexamining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still\nremain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by\nimplementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.\nLiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster\nlevels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in\ncode-centric LLM reasoning.",

        "summary": "Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite\nhumans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of\nmedalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,\nexamining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still\nremain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by\nimplementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.\nLiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster\nlevels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in\ncode-centric LLM reasoning.",

However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate\nfeature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for\ndownstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible\nfeature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from\nany Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs\nan attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between\nhigh-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and\nsemantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform\n(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,\nwe demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions\ngeneralizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive\nexperiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details\nand consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a\ndiverse set of downstream tasks.

JAFAR employs\nan attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between\nhigh-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and\nsemantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform\n(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,\nwe demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions\ngeneralizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive\nexperiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details\nand consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a\ndiverse set of downstream tasks.

However, current approaches often struggle with resource\nefficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment\nin content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce\nU-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely\non prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity\nmeme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual\ndescriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme\nclassification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual\ncontent and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general\nlarge language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we\nfurther incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide\nmodels' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows\nfor easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across\nplatforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and\nexplainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and\nlow-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are\navailable at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.",

        "summary": "Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online\nenvironments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource\nefficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment\nin content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce\nU-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely\non prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity\nmeme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual\ndescriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme\nclassification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual\ncontent and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general\nlarge language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we\nfurther incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide\nmodels' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows\nfor easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across\nplatforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and\nexplainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and\nlow-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are\navailable at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.",
