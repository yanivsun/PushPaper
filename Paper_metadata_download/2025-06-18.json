However, existing\nbenchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or\nmulti-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world\nmusic analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as\ninstruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music\ninstruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a\ndiverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre\nclassification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,\npitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal\ntechnique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music\ntagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges\nin MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized\nevaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,\nensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an\nevaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including\nLTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant\nperformance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,\nchronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of\ncurrent models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified\nfoundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in\nmusic-aware LLMs.",

        "title": "CMI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Music Instruction\n  Following",
        "summary": "Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new\npossibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing\nbenchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or\nmulti-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world\nmusic analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as\ninstruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music\ninstruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a\ndiverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre\nclassification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,\npitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal\ntechnique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music\ntagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges\nin MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized\nevaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,\nensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an\nevaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including\nLTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant\nperformance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,\nchronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of\ncurrent models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified\nfoundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in\nmusic-aware LLMs.",

Traditional methods rely on OCR and\nlanguage models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON\ngeneration. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit\ntheir effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges\nusing only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a\nbalanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve\nfield coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning\ncapabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1,\nprecision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical\ndatasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for\ndomain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of\nreasoning during training and inference for VIE.",

        "title": "Efficient Medical VIE via Reinforcement Learning",
        "summary": "Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images\ninto structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as\nreport analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and\nlanguage models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON\ngeneration. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit\ntheir effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges\nusing only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a\nbalanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve\nfield coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning\ncapabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1,\nprecision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical\ndatasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for\ndomain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of\nreasoning during training and inference for VIE.",

Consistency models\ncan distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike\nflow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when\nincreasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and\nempirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise\nlevels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this\npaper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps,\nalong with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing\nconsistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that\nautoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance\nduring distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial\nfinetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our\nflow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation\nbenchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both\nImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks.

Additionally, QFFT exhibits\nsuperior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource\nscenarios.",

We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our\napproach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus\nlimited unbiased data across diffusion times.",

However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.
