Traditional motion synthesis methods are either\nrestricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in\nhigh-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers\nvideo-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated\nmeshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,\nmulti-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on\ntemplate renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional\nencodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment\nbetween video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to\nmotion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are\ntriangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via\ninverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged\nsequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in\ngeneralization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution\nfor category-agnostic 3D animation.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model\n(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process\nof professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching\ntools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an\ninitial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning\nand tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for\nRetouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool\nproficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate\nseamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop\nMMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.\nJarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and\nfine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new\navenue for intelligent photo retouching.

This\nformulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from\nlarge-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,\nUniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to\ndownstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach\nsets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation\nbenchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly\nsurpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success\nrate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate\nits broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous\ndriving.",

Our\nanalysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as\nthe primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task\ncomplexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality\ndemonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.\nWe leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical\nreasoning capabilities.",

        "title": "Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic\n  Empirical Study",
        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,\nyet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of\nreasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to\nenhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed\ndataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three\ndimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our\nanalysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as\nthe primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task\ncomplexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality\ndemonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.\nWe leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical\nreasoning capabilities.",
