            "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their\noutputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is\na persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers\na path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the\nscarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test\ngeneration, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can\nmisdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated\nSolver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to\nvalidate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on\nspecific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define\nand verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the\n\"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are\nmeant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their\noutputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is\na persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers\na path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the\nscarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test\ngeneration, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can\nmisdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated\nSolver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to\nvalidate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on\nspecific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define\nand verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the\n\"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are\nmeant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.",

Furthermore, we introduce\nModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise\nmodality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that\nModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical\nmodels on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.",

However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and\nunengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive\nexperiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and\ncinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.",

        "title": "FilMaster: Bridging Cinematic Principles and Generative AI for Automated\n  Film Generation",
        "summary": "AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and\nunengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive\nexperiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and\ncinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.",
