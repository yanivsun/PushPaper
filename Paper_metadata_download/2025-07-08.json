While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),\nreducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.\nWe release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further\nresearch.",

However, the\nmajority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames\nper second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS\ninput may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D\ncapturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and\nprocessing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture\nscheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of\ncameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our\nmethod achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring\nspecialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel\ngenerative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as\nasynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we\npropose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D\nreconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,\nand improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to\nsynchronous capture.",

To address these limitations, we propose\nDreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge\nforecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a\nperception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,\nDreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,\nintegrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet\ncomprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how\nhumans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning\nchains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation\nenvironments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real\nrobot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.",

We introduce\nAgent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic\nproblem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses\na core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's\nexperiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3\nimproves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on\nintermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to\nimprove from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a\nmodular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from\npast experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.",

        "title": "Agent KB: Leveraging Cross-Domain Experience for Agentic Problem Solving",
        "summary": "As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with\neffective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce\nAgent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic\nproblem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses\na core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's\nexperiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3\nimproves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on\nintermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to\nimprove from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a\nmodular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from\npast experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.",

            "summary": "The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply\ninfluenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing\ndata quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the\ntrade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While\nrule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at\nthe document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content\nwithin documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose\nRefineX, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of\npre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient\nand fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and\nnaturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling\nhigh-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal\nedit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used\nto train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve\nevery instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch\npre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms\nmodels trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse\ndownstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on\nlighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer\ntraining tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text\nquality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches\nsuch as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a\nscalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in\nmodern LLM pipelines.",

        "summary": "The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply\ninfluenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing\ndata quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the\ntrade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While\nrule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at\nthe document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content\nwithin documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose\nRefineX, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of\npre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient\nand fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and\nnaturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling\nhigh-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal\nedit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used\nto train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve\nevery instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch\npre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms\nmodels trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse\ndownstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on\nlighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer\ntraining tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text\nquality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches\nsuch as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a\nscalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in\nmodern LLM pipelines.",

Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We\nevaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our\nmodel enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive\ngeneration, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in\nour project website: <a href=\"https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/\">this\nhttps URL.</a>",

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results\nreveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,\nunderscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms\nfor LLM agents.",

This\nestablishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the\nassessment of human-perceived quality at scale.

Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2\nachieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document\nretrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image\nbenchmarks.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI\nadoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility\nfor resource-constrained environments.",

Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI\nadoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility\nfor resource-constrained environments.",

            "summary": "Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet\nchallenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,\nhigh-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive\nexperiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nimage-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with\nsuperior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world\ngeneralization.",
