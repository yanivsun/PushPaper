We\nintroduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework\nspecifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show\nthat higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,\nnecessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates\ntwo key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts\nrank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight\nparametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components\nthrough orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and\nits individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model\npersonalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept\nfidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in\ndata-limited and resource-constrained scenarios.

            "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nremarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex\nreasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To\nfoster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and\nbenchmark are available. Our project page is:\nhttps://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/",

        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nremarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex\nreasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail\nto preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can\ngenerate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy\nand low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form\nvideos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity\ndetail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify\nkey architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield\nthese qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing\nmethods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their\narchitectural designs and performance characteristics.",

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they\nadequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large\nlanguage model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better\nand even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space\ngreatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained\nmodules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample\nfrom math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a\nfixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same\nlayer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic\narchitectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our\nresults highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained\nLLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the\ngeneralization power of test-time depth adaptation.",
