            "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans\nwith sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

        "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans\nwith sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial\nlandmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and\nstruggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack\nsupport for multi-character animation, as driving features from different\nindividuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked\ncross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression\ngeneration, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in\nthis area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are\nspecifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating\nmulti-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nquantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in\nchallenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

To improve the\nsafety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive\ninference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any\nfine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core\ncomponents: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically\nidentifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal\nlayers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of\ntoxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal\nHead that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are\ndetected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical\nbenchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success\nRate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining\ngeneral abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,\ninterpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI\nsystems.",
