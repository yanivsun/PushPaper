To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.

We then examine\nrecent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and\nopportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological\nconsiderations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,\nevaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and\ninference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on\nsparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.\nBy synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured\nand critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and\noutline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and\nIRL techniques.",

            "summary": "The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several\napproaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.",

        "summary": "The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several\napproaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.",

Traditional risk measures such as Value-at-Risk\n(VaR) have demonstrated significant limitations during periods of market\nstress, as evidenced during the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent volatile\nperiods. This study develops an advanced expectile-based framework that\naddresses the shortcomings of conventional quantile-based approaches by\nproviding greater sensitivity to tail losses and improved stability in extreme\nmarket conditions. The research employs a dataset spanning two decades of FTSE\n100 returns, incorporating periods of high volatility, market crashes, and\nrecovery phases. Our methodology introduces novel mathematical formulations for\nexpectile regression models, enhanced threshold determination techniques using\ntime series analysis, and robust backtesting procedures. The empirical results\ndemonstrate that expectile-based Value-at-Risk (EVaR) consistently outperforms\ntraditional VaR measures across various confidence levels and market\nconditions. The framework exhibits superior performance during volatile\nperiods, with reduced model risk and enhanced predictive accuracy. Furthermore,\nthe study establishes practical implementation guidelines for financial\ninstitutions and provides evidence-based recommendations for regulatory\ncompliance and portfolio management. The findings contribute significantly to\nthe literature on financial risk management and offer practical tools for\npractitioners dealing with volatile market environments.",
