Current\nreinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as\nhit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature\nof spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally\nforms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI\nGaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G^2), a principled reward framework that\nmodels GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface\nplane. GUI-G^2 incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point\nrewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions\ncentered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment\nby measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target\nregions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance\nmechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.\nThis framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to\ndense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich\ngradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.\nExtensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G^2, substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of\n24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

During synthesis, we begin by\ncreating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an\nagentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with\nretrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model\non the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper\nachieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and\nWebWalkerQA benchmarks.",

To\naddress this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation\nmanipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web\ndata. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training\nparadigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical\nspace alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which\nachieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand\ntrajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further\ndevelop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous\nsources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a\nlarge-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We\nempirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and\ninstruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.\nImportantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic\nmanipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",

We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity.
