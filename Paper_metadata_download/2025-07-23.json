By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric\nreinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate\ngenuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the\ngeneration of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly\nenhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking\nstyles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic\nknowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to\nmitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions\nof hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and\nexpressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results\ndemonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\naudio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source\nand commercial solutions.

To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage\nnoise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying\nresolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving\nimage quality by achieving up to 7.0times speed-up on FLUX and 3.0times\non Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

However, since LVLMs\nare mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt\non-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability\nbecause the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL\noffers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling\ntrajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to\nmismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for\nvision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy\nbehavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable\nLVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns\noutcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.\nThen LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning\ntrajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the\neffectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in\naverage, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on\nmultiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some\nclosed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and\nOlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.\nAnalysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy\nRL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy\ntraining.",

Recently,\nZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use\nunlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information\nrequired for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection\nnetworks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box\nand category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set\nfrom the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and\ncategory distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate\ntask-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the\nperformance of quantized detection networks.

In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware\nframework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.\nInstead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual\nobjects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,\nenabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically\ngrow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID\nencoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We\nshow through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,\nbut also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene\nediting.

        "title": "ObjectGS: Object-aware Scene Reconstruction and Scene Understanding via\n  Gaussian Splatting",
        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and\nreal-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits\nobject-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware\nframework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.\nInstead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual\nobjects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,\nenabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically\ngrow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID\nencoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We\nshow through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,\nbut also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene\nediting.
