We address\nthis through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.\nFirst, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,\nconsisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across\nthe U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene\nprovides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic\nsegmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain\ndiversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored\nframework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent\ndiffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)\nDual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D\nGaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the\ncostly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving\ncritical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models\ntrained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model\nlatent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely\nlarge-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,\nfrom semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain\nsynthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data\npriors from Aerial-Earth3D.

            "summary": "Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and\nare highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,\ndevelopmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of\nSpelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when\nacted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models.",

        "title": "Discovering and using Spelke segments",
        "summary": "Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and\nare highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,\ndevelopmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of\nSpelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when\nacted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models.",
