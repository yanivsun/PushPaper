            "summary": "Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on\nplatforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.\nHowever, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,\ndetailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the\ncornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging\nvideo applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due\nto their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and\naudio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint\ndelivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal\ninformation, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce\nARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual\nsignals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The\nmodel is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and\nsummarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,\nand video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation\npipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive\nregimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative\nevaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative\ncomparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video\ncomprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for\ndiverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our\nmodel has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and\nsatisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress\ntests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on\nH20 GPU.",

        "title": "ARC-Hunyuan-Video-7B: Structured Video Comprehension of Real-World\n  Shorts",
        "summary": "Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on\nplatforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.\nHowever, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,\ndetailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the\ncornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging\nvideo applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due\nto their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and\naudio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint\ndelivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal\ninformation, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce\nARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual\nsignals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The\nmodel is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and\nsummarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,\nand video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation\npipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive\nregimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative\nevaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative\ncomparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video\ncomprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for\ndiverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our\nmodel has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and\nsatisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress\ntests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on\nH20 GPU.",

            "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain\nfundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,\nevolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.",

        "title": "A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super\n  Intelligence",
        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain\nfundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,\nevolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.",

However, GRPO suffers from unstable\npolicy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,\nwhich manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,\nthe ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current\nand old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization\n(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic\nmean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is\ninherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of\nimportance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical\nand experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.\nBeyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on\nmultiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,\nincluding AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

        "summary": "Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have\nenhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the\narithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable\npolicy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,\nwhich manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,\nthe ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current\nand old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization\n(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic\nmean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is\ninherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of\nimportance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical\nand experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.\nBeyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on\nmultiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,\nincluding AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster\nDiscrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR\ncapabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and\npropose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We\nfurther design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly\nsupports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,\nenabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.\nExtensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods\non tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been\nreleased at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.",

While Music Arena\nfollows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with\nkey features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the\nheterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*\npreferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also\npropose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a\nrenewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.\nThrough its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,\nand music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in\nthe TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully\nadapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.\n  Music Arena is available at: https://music-arena.org",

During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated.
