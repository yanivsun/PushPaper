However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length.

While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.",

However, current\nagent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid\nAPIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the\nresearch community. In this work, we present Cognitive Kernel-Pro, a\nfully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework\ndesigned to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.\nWithin Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of\nhigh-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the\nconstruction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key\ndomains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel\nstrategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent\nrobustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our\n8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as\nWebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for\naccessible, high-capability AI agents.

        "summary": "General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for\nthe next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web\ninteraction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current\nagent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid\nAPIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the\nresearch community. In this work, we present Cognitive Kernel-Pro, a\nfully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework\ndesigned to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.\nWithin Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of\nhigh-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the\nconstruction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key\ndomains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel\nstrategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent\nrobustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our\n8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as\nWebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for\naccessible, high-capability AI agents.

We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity.

Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

            "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.

        "title": "IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation",
        "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.
