To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a\ncomprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,\nfiltering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a\nprogressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,\nevolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to\nparagraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially\nenhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,\nQwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as\nEnglish, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic\nlanguages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an\nimproved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional\ntext-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also\nimage-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent\nrepresentations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed\nthe original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and\nreconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism\nenables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic\nconsistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both\nimage generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.",

On the other hand, AI models may not be able to correctly identify the\nartist for real paintings, inducing users to incorrectly attribute paintings.\nIn this paper, both problems are experimentally studied using state-of-the-art\nAI models for image generation and analysis on a large dataset with close to\n40,000 paintings from 128 artists. The results show that vision language models\nhave limited capabilities to: 1) perform canvas attribution and 2) to identify\nAI generated images. As users increasingly rely on queries to AI models to get\ninformation, these results show the need to improve the capabilities of VLMs to\nreliably perform artist attribution and detection of AI generated images to\nprevent the spread of incorrect information.",

This paper introduces SHAMI-MT, a\nbidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the\ncommunication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two\nspecialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA\ntranslation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024\narchitecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and\nrigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami\nmodel achieved an outstanding average quality score of 4.01 out of 5.0\nwhen judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce\ntranslations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This\nwork provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved\nlanguage pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering\nsignificant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and\nintercultural communication.",

            "summary": "Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,\nyet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.\nMost existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from\ninput images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and\npoint maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often\nfails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical\napplicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly\nmodels the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable\njoint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model\ndesigned for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively\nbuild a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically\ninvariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder\nbackbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to\nmaintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.\nBy integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,\nDens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface\nnormals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to\nmulti-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that\nsupports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D\nprediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.",

        "title": "Dens3R: A Foundation Model for 3D Geometry Prediction",
        "summary": "Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,\nyet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.\nMost existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from\ninput images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and\npoint maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often\nfails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical\napplicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly\nmodels the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable\njoint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model\ndesigned for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively\nbuild a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically\ninvariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder\nbackbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to\nmaintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.\nBy integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,\nDens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface\nnormals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to\nmulti-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that\nsupports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D\nprediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.",
