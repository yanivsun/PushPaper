To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a\nmulti-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language\nreasoning capabilities.

Finally,\nwe employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on\nthese multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character\nrepresentations.

            "summary": "Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and\ncoding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in\nchallenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are\ngenerally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.\nHowever, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can\nleverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an\nagent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning\n(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data\nefficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we\npropose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with\nhierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep\nsearch agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.\nAt the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides\nthe final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error\npropagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and\nirrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents.

        "summary": "Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and\ncoding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in\nchallenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are\ngenerally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.\nHowever, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can\nleverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an\nagent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning\n(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data\nefficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we\npropose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with\nhierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep\nsearch agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains.\nAt the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides\nthe final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error\npropagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and\nirrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that\nHierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms\nvarious deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines\nin six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.",

Furthermore, this\ntranslates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain\nand 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and\n18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing\nthe baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%,\nrespectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium,\nshowing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer\nparameters.",

            "summary": "Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to\nsynthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity\nconsistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video\ndiffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos\nwithout post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the\ninfinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy\nthat fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness\nof StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "title": "StableAvatar: Infinite-Length Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation",
        "summary": "Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to\nsynthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity\nconsistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video\ndiffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos\nwithout post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the\ninfinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy\nthat fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness\nof StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

The variation\nprotocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --\nyielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's\no1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy\ndrops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The\nremaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with\nnon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and\nhighlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement \"boxed\" accuracy\nwith Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores\nreasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM\ntherefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for\nassessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are\npublicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.",

We introduce\nPutnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn\nfrom the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and\nPutnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants\ngenerated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation\nprotocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --\nyielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's\no1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy\ndrops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The\nremaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with\nnon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and\nhighlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement \"boxed\" accuracy\nwith Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores\nreasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM\ntherefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for\nassessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are\npublicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.",

By unifying the recognition and generation of\nparalinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale,\nword-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin,\nintegrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.\nDataset and audio demos are available at https://nvspeech170k.github.io/.",
