            "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising\nalternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential\nto decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing\nopen-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of\nsimilar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective\nstrategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key\ncapabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache\nutilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of\nprior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs\nare refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.\nD2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on\npre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,\nwhich enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F\ndLLMs achieve more than 2.5times inference speed than LLaMA3 and\nQwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the\nacceleration can be more than 50times while maintaining comparable\noutput quality.

        "title": "Diffusion LLMs Can Do Faster-Than-AR Inference via Discrete Diffusion\n  Forcing",
        "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising\nalternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential\nto decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing\nopen-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of\nsimilar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective\nstrategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key\ncapabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache\nutilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of\nprior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs\nare refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.\nD2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on\npre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,\nwhich enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F\ndLLMs achieve more than 2.5times inference speed than LLaMA3 and\nQwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the\nacceleration can be more than 50times while maintaining comparable\noutput quality.

            "summary": "Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong\nperformance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.\nSeveral studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance\nopen-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",

        "title": "Echo-4o: Harnessing the Power of GPT-4o Synthetic Images for Improved\n  Image Generation",
        "summary": "Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong\nperformance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.\nSeveral studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance\nopen-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",

However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or\nprocessed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by\nreal-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the\nproblem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in\nrealistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis\nof their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their\nrecognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining\ndirections for future improvements.

        "title": "MathReal: We Keep It Real! A Real Scene Benchmark for Evaluating Math\n  Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing\nbenchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or\nprocessed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by\nreal-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the\nproblem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in\nrealistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis\nof their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their\nrecognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining\ndirections for future improvements.

        "summary": "Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with\nmuTransfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in\nlarge-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a\nleading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of\nthese two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a\nmu-Parameterization (muP) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for\nfeature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We\nempirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling\nthe number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.",

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train\nan outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers\nthat utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,\ninter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,\nenables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused\nby cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various\nreal-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model\nuncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst\nagents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete\nin-flight loss of one MAV.

            "summary": "Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language\nmodels, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data\nleakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with\nthe attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated\nfrom the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to\nimprove. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate\npreviously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that\nmore recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership\ninference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections.",
