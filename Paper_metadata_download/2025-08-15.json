Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and\nmethod optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive\nknowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,\nwe introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured\nmathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math\n2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level\nhierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental\nprinciples. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a\ntwo-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the\nmodel with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive\nAlignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to\nachieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with\ndiverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that\nMathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used\nbenchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising\ngeneralization in mathematical reasoning.",

Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /\n50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,\nScreenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including\nopen-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and\nplaning ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI\nnavigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%\nsuccess rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce\ncarefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks\nand corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost\nnavigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment\n\\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and\nbalances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more\ncoherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our\ncontributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive\ndata cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving\nnavigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the\ncommunity.
