Ovis2.5 integrates a\nnative-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,\nvariable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and\npreserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense\ncontent like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to\nmove beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including\nself-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional\n\"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced\naccuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive\nfive-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins\nwith foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through\nlarge-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning\nenhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ\nmultimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant\nend-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and\nOvis2.5-2B. The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy\nof Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the\nOpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a\nsubstantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter\nrange; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate\nscores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong\ncapabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its\nscale for complex chart analysis.",

Our framework consists of three key components: (1)\nA scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to\neffectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with\ndiverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables\nframe-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step\ndistillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video\ngeneration. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos\nacross diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS.

While effective, this requirement largely\nconfines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome\nthis, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating\nrubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,\nmodel-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We\nconstruct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with\nover 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.\nImplementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a\nclear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable\ngains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended\nbenchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by\n+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides\nfine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the\n\"AI-like\" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key\nlessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss\nlimitations and future releases.",

In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable\nsignals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct\nanswers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely\nconfines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome\nthis, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating\nrubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,\nmodel-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We\nconstruct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with\nover 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.\nImplementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a\nclear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable\ngains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended\nbenchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by\n+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides\nfine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the\n\"AI-like\" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key\nlessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss\nlimitations and future releases.",

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.
