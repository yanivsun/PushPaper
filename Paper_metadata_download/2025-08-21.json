Existing benchmarks solely rely on\nscore-level evaluation, summarizing performance with a single score that\nobscures the nuanced understanding of what models truly know and their precise\nlimitations. They also rely on datasets that cover only a narrow subset of\nfinancial concepts, while overlooking other essentials for real-world\napplications. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCDM, the first cognitive\ndiagnosis evaluation framework tailored for financial LLMs, enabling the\nevaluation of LLMs at the knowledge-skill level, identifying what financial\nskills and knowledge they have or lack based on their response patterns across\nskill-tagged tasks, rather than a single aggregated number. We construct\nCPA-QKA, the first cognitively informed financial evaluation dataset derived\nfrom the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, with comprehensive\ncoverage of real-world accounting and financial skills. It is rigorously\nannotated by domain experts, who author, validate, and annotate questions with\nhigh inter-annotator agreement and fine-grained knowledge labels. Our extensive\nexperiments on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs show that\nFinCDM reveals hidden knowledge gaps, identifies under-tested areas such as tax\nand regulatory reasoning overlooked by traditional benchmarks, and uncovers\nbehavioral clusters among models. FinCDM introduces a new paradigm for\nfinancial LLM evaluation by enabling interpretable, skill-aware diagnosis that\nsupports more trustworthy and targeted model development, and all datasets and\nevaluation scripts will be publicly released to support further research.",

Agents must not only gather and interpret\nvast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,\nweigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as\nhuman experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\nFutureX, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive\nreasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide\nin-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in\nfuture-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the\ntemporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free\nevaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of\nperforming at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and\npredictive thinking.",

            "summary": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for\nconnecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly\ngaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

        "summary": "The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for\nconnecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly\ngaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

We create\nNemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model\n(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.\nAfter aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to\ncompress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to\n128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).\nCompared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that\nNemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks\nwhile achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like\n8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,\nNemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with\nthe majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.",

        "summary": "We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model\ndesigned to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving\nstate-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.\nNemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the\nmajority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture\nare replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when\ngenerating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create\nNemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model\n(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.\nAfter aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to\ncompress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to\n128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).\nCompared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that\nNemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks\nwhile achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like\n8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,\nNemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with\nthe majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.",

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by\naccelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to\nmaterials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial\nhuman oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing\ndomain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge\nacross disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of\nmore general-purpose AI systems for science.

Most VLMs\nunderperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3\n(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially\nshort of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English\ninstructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,\ndecreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop\ncollaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.\nCode and data are available at: https://vi-exam.github.io.",

The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the\npowerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these\nmethods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although\ncontrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to\naddress the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main\nlimitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective\nrepresentations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable\ninformation in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the\nhomograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in\nincomplete mining of user-item interplay.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for\nREfining multi-modAl contRastive learning\nand hoMography relations (REARM). Specifically, we complement\nmulti-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal\nconstraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and\nretain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine\nhomogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user\ninterest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user\nco-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM\nto various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an\nimprovement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and\nmodal-unique features. Code is available\nhttps://github.com/MrShouxingMa/REARM{here}.",
