On the one hand,\nvideos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial\nconsistency prior for 3D generation.

Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to\nproduce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content.

            "summary": "The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a\ncornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is\nsuboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift\ndynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving\npreferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant\nchallenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically\nadjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX\nintroduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of\ndata domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data\nmixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.\nWe solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and\nTiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We\ntrained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion\ntokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like\nREGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to\nan average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks.

        "summary": "The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a\ncornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is\nsuboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift\ndynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving\npreferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant\nchallenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically\nadjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX\nintroduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of\ndata domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data\nmixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.\nWe solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and\nTiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We\ntrained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion\ntokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like\nREGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to\nan average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our\nexperiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training\nprogress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data\nmixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,\nsignificantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data\nseen with static ratios.",
