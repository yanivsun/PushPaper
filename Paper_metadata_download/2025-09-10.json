However, activating such capabilities through training\nremains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced\nimitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we\npropose Parallel-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework\nthat enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning\ntasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses\nthe cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT\non prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel\nthinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on\nharder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,\nand AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,\nleading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model\ntrained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear\nshift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel\nthinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same\ncapability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate\nparallel thinking as a mid-training exploration scaffold, where this\ntemporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,\nyielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25.

However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs\nrequires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces\nnon-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)\nalongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy\nOptimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training\nalgorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute\nnodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while \"sharing\" rollouts\nwith others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model\nhomogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.\nAs a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL\npost-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By\nsampling rollouts \"shared\" across the network, it enables \"Aha moments\" to\npropagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show\nSAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.\nWe also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes\ncontributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse\nhardware and models during an open-source demo.",

For instance,\nStable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a\n2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with\nmore than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both\nFLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.",

        "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring\ndozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,\nStable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a\n2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with\nmore than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both\nFLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.",
