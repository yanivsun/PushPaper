OmniWorld\nconsists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public\ndatasets spanning diverse domains.

This limitation\nbecomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language\nmodels. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies\ncreate highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives\nthat no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address\nthis limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively\nadjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike\nexisting approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic\nweighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,\nfacilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We\nintroduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)\nhypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight\noptimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective\nalignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with\ncommonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,\nREINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning\ndatasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving\nPareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear\nscalarization baselines.",

        "title": "Learning to Optimize Multi-Objective Alignment Through Dynamic Reward\n  Weighting",
        "summary": "Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear\nreward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture\nnon-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation\nbecomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language\nmodels. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies\ncreate highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives\nthat no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address\nthis limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively\nadjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike\nexisting approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic\nweighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,\nfacilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We\nintroduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)\nhypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight\noptimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective\nalignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with\ncommonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,\nREINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning\ndatasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving\nPareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear\nscalarization baselines.",

            "summary": "Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model\ngenerates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks\nin real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to\nunsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test\nrecognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct\nanswer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for\ntrustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a\nbehavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new\nhallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible\nbut incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and\nattribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained\nscene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and\nprompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a\nrigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a \"None of the above\"\noption, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but\nalso to identify when no provided answer is valid.

        "summary": "Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model\ngenerates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks\nin real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to\nunsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test\nrecognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct\nanswer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for\ntrustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a\nbehavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new\nhallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible\nbut incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and\nattribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained\nscene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and\nprompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a\nrigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a \"None of the above\"\noption, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but\nalso to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized\nreasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights\nwith the community.

However, these models continue to suffer from\nhallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address\nthis issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,\ntemporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained\nspatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark\ndataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes\n10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched\nwith detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in\nLVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the\nperceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This\nstep-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively\nidentifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is\neffective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and\nreliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in\nreal-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.",

        "title": "Dr.V: A Hierarchical Perception-Temporal-Cognition Framework to Diagnose\n  Video Hallucination by Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Grounding",
        "summary": "Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance\nvideo understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from\nhallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address\nthis issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,\ntemporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained\nspatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark\ndataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes\n10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched\nwith detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in\nLVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the\nperceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This\nstep-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively\nidentifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is\neffective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and\nreliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in\nreal-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.",

            "summary": "Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech\nlanguage modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic\nfeatures, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human\nspeech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from\nself-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from\npre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the\nsemantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies\nacoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal\nalignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary\ntechniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and\ncontextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and\nunified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,\nsupervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted\nrepresentations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and\n(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by\ndynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for\nfine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,\ndemonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.\nEmpirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,\nsurpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,\nperceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight\nthe effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for\nspeech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are\navailable at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.",

        "title": "FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs",
        "summary": "Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech\nlanguage modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic\nfeatures, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human\nspeech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from\nself-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from\npre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the\nsemantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies\nacoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal\nalignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary\ntechniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and\ncontextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and\nunified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,\nsupervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted\nrepresentations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and\n(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by\ndynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for\nfine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,\ndemonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.\nEmpirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,\nsurpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,\nperceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight\nthe effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for\nspeech tokenization and downstream tasks.

However, existing benchmarks\ntend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially\nunder realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,\nand often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present\nLongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It\ncovers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion\nDetection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion\nExpression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,\nwith long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance\nperformance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them\nwith standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG\nmethod leverages both the conversation context and the large language model\nitself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The\nCoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five\nstages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge\ninjection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently\nenhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs\ntoward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted\na comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the\ndifferences among various models in terms of EI.
