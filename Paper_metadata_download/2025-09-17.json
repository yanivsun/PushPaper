To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process.

By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art\nacross major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and\nDeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative\nmethodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are\ncrucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.",

            "summary": "Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nopened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer\ndiagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and\nefficiency.

        "title": "Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining\n  for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis",
        "summary": "Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nopened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer\ndiagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and\nefficiency.

            "summary": "We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired\nRGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted\nto 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few\nmanual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,\na curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from\nObjaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part\nvideo sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse\nscenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare\narticulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream\nanimation and motion-related tasks.",

Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted\nto 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few\nmanual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,\na curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from\nObjaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part\nvideo sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse\nscenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare\narticulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream\nanimation and motion-related tasks.",

            "summary": "Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for\nvirtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are\ntypically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that\nrely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they\ncan be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient\ndescent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal\nprocessing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks,\nallowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers\nfaster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of\nquadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling\namplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised\nvia the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can\nsuccessfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix\nLA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked.\nWe leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient\ntraining on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/aim-qmul/4a2a.",

        "summary": "Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for\nvirtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are\ntypically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that\nrely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they\ncan be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient\ndescent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal\nprocessing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks,\nallowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers\nfaster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of\nquadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling\namplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised\nvia the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can\nsuccessfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix\nLA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked.\nWe leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient\ntraining on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/aim-qmul/4a2a.",
