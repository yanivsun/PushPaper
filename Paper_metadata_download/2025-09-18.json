Meanwhile, a growing number of\ntestbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models.\nThus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to\nbroaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team\nreleased two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support\ngeneral reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in\nadvertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include\nboth generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition\ntracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question\nAnswering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative\nAdvertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and\nindustrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of\n1200+) have been included in our ranking lists.

Our framework empowers a central LLM or\nMLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual\ntools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code\nexecution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these\ntools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a\nhybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and\nMLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model\nbackbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nexisting methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a\nnovel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains.\nProject Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/LLM-I.",

In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when\ncomposed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover\nsensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We\npresent the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and\npossible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration.

Specifically, we propose a\nplug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the\nrobustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence\nspeed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \\ie, pFID, which successfully\ncorrelates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During\npost-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a\nwell-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between\ngenerated and reconstructed tokens. With a sim400M generator, a discrete\ntokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID\nand further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training.
