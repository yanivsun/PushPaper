In\nthis work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned\nspecifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset\ncombining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a\ndecoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving\ngeneral visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,\nexpert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR\nsystems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing\nopen-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing\na new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results\nhighlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs\nand establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich\nlanguages like Arabic.",

On the contrary, we propose the State-free\nPolicy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only\nconditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the\nrelative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant\nvisual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger\nspatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as\npick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation,\nspanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\\%\nto 85\\% in height generalization and from 6\\% to 64\\% in horizontal\ngeneralization.

            "summary": "The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications\nranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous\ndriving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods\nrely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not\nalways readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have\nshown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the\napplications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with\nthe environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that\naims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for\nmulti-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with\na 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this\napproach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated\nby video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D\nscenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our\nframework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input\nvideo. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.",

        "summary": "The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications\nranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous\ndriving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods\nrely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not\nalways readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have\nshown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the\napplications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with\nthe environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that\naims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for\nmulti-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with\na 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this\napproach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated\nby video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D\nscenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our\nframework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input\nvideo. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.",

However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing\nexponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization.\nReliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate\nand curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was\nrecently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models\n(VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we\npropose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across\ndiverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human\nembodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source\nfoundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly\nunderperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately 70% of\ntheir performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data\ncuration and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale\nrobotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at\ngithub.com/budzianowski/opengvl{OpenGVL}.",

        "summary": "Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in\nrobotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing\nexponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization.\nReliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate\nand curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was\nrecently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models\n(VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we\npropose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across\ndiverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human\nembodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source\nfoundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly\nunderperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately 70% of\ntheir performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data\ncuration and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale\nrobotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at\ngithub.com/budzianowski/opengvl{OpenGVL}.",

However, 3DGS suffers from\nsignificant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to\nmodel view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose\ncompressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture\nhigh-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded\nreconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a\nnovel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians\nand neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit\nGaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based\nneural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational\ncapacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately\nmodeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color.\nAdditionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian\nsplatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in\ndistant scene representation.

            "summary": "Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing\napplications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and\nurban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional\nspectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such\nas ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,\nand their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,\nonly adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is\npredominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for\nmulti-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,\nalthough providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs\ncannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are\ncapable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand\nspecialized multi-spectral signals.\n  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new\nmulti-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist\nmultimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the\nmultimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to\ninputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions\ninto the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe\nstrong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing\nbenchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy\nadaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential\nfor geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to\neasily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate\ntheir work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,\ngrounded in the specialized sensor data.",

        "summary": "Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing\napplications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and\nurban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional\nspectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such\nas ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,\nand their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,\nonly adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is\npredominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for\nmulti-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,\nalthough providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs\ncannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are\ncapable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand\nspecialized multi-spectral signals.\n  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new\nmulti-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist\nmultimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the\nmultimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to\ninputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions\ninto the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe\nstrong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing\nbenchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy\nadaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential\nfor geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to\neasily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate\ntheir work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,\ngrounded in the specialized sensor data.",
