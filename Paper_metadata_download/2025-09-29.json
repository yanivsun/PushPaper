In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout\nanalysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing\nthe computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second\nstage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on\nnative-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving\nfine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support\nthis strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,\nlarge-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,\nMinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,\nwhile maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.",

            "summary": "The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have\nspurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are\ninadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We\nintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI\nassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval\ncomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks\ninclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn\ndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly\nheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21\nopen-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response\ncontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key\nfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source\nmodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;\nand (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the\nmid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening\naccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal\n(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for\ncurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety\nalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous\nframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI\nassistants.

        "summary": "The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have\nspurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are\ninadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We\nintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI\nassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval\ncomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks\ninclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn\ndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly\nheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21\nopen-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response\ncontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key\nfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source\nmodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;\nand (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the\nmid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening\naccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal\n(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for\ncurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety\nalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous\nframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI\nassistants. Code and data will be released at\nhttps://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .",

            "summary": "Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nincreasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback\n(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential\nreward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still\nwastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each\nupdate. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And\nReward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable\nmethod that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness\ndata, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the\nmodel itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix\nof objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and\nevaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to\nevaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a\nseparate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a\npositive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better\npolicy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further\nrefine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via\nself-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We\nshow that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM\nmodels and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For\nexample, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,\n12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the\nbaselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.",

        "summary": "Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nincreasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback\n(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential\nreward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still\nwastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each\nupdate. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And\nReward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable\nmethod that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness\ndata, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the\nmodel itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix\nof objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and\nevaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to\nevaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a\nseparate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a\npositive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better\npolicy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further\nrefine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via\nself-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We\nshow that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM\nmodels and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For\nexample, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,\n12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the\nbaselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.",

            "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the\nimportant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external\nknowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.",

        "title": "Think-on-Graph 3.0: Efficient and Adaptive LLM Reasoning on\n  Heterogeneous Graphs via Multi-Agent Dual-Evolving Context Retrieval",
        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the\nimportant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external\nknowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.",

            "summary": "Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward\nover-optimization, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve\nhigh scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the\ninability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.\nThis motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail\nexamples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from\nstronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them\nyields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,\nwe study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy\nexamples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that\ncapture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing\namong great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this\nidea.

        "summary": "Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward\nover-optimization, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve\nhigh scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the\ninability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.\nThis motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail\nexamples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from\nstronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them\nyields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,\nwe study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy\nexamples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that\ncapture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing\namong great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this\nidea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially\nmitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training\nimprovements.

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.

Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.
