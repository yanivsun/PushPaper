With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x\nreduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration\nwithout loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention\ncomputation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,\noutperforming baseline methods.

While this\nperspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong\ntheoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to\ntwo-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture\nthe full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we\nintroduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework\nthat generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an\nn-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents\nwhile being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes\nwell-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of\nduality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO\ninherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer\ncompetitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.\nThrough comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently\noutperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,\nachieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions\nand mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO\nas a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,\nnon-transitive human preferences.

            "summary": "We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently\ngenerate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.\nSANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with\nstrong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090\nGPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with\nglobal context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional\nKV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we\nexplore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the\ntraining cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of\nMovieGen.

        "summary": "We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently\ngenerate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.\nSANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with\nstrong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090\nGPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with\nglobal context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional\nKV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we\nexplore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the\ntraining cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of\nMovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance\ncompared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B\nand SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency.

            "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,\nenabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,\nplanning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly\nrepresentative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It\nhighlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical\ninformation in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,\nnumerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they\nare often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and\nrarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we\nintroduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning\nbenchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the\nwidely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed\nautomated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,\nwe curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source\nand closed-source models on GSM8K-V.

        "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,\nenabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,\nplanning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly\nrepresentative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It\nhighlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical\ninformation in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,\nnumerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they\nare often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and\nrarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we\nintroduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning\nbenchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the\nwidely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed\nautomated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,\nwe curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source\nand closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs\nhave nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains\nsubstantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing\nmodel, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on\nGSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the\nlimitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.\nGSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and\nestablishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and\ngeneralizable VLMs.",

            "summary": "RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nimproving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current\nmethods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,\nwhich follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating\nthe current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While\neffective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,\nrequiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning.

        "summary": "RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nimproving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current\nmethods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,\nwhich follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating\nthe current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While\neffective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,\nrequiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning.

We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video\ngeneration technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error\naccumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of\niteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we\ndesign a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames\nwith progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict\ncausality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,\nwe introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video\ngeneration task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial\nframes as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global\nconsistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables\nfew-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm\noperates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on\nself-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing\nenables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,\nwith substantially reduced error accumulation.",

            "summary": "We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\nCompression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically\noscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically\nbalance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal\n\"sweet spot\" between the two. Our models are publicly available.",

        "title": "SIRI: Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\n  Compression",
        "summary": "We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved\nCompression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically\noscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically\nbalance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal\n\"sweet spot\" between the two. Our models are publicly available.",

Unlike cascaded pipelines that\nisolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a \"brain-mouth\" design with a\ndual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal\nreasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient\ncross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For\nunderstanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder\ndesign enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.\nFor generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech\ntoken-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice\ncloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent\nwork, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing\nopen source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,\nproducing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form\naudio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,\nend-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised\nlong-horizon speech generation.",

        "summary": "We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and\nexpressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that\nisolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a \"brain-mouth\" design with a\ndual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal\nreasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient\ncross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For\nunderstanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder\ndesign enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.\nFor generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech\ntoken-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice\ncloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent\nwork, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing\nopen source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,\nproducing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form\naudio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,\nend-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised\nlong-horizon speech generation.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI\nagents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.\nDART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment\ncluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables\nnon-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory\nsampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the\nsystem efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,\nand 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from\nabundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)\npre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement\nsparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers\nand trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on\nhigh-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning\nvia truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout\nand updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task\nsuccess rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than\nopen-source SOTA.

A significant challenge in this process is\nthe distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the\nevolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static\nheuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to\nadapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMeta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework\nthat dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a\nlightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the\npotential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This\nguides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the\noptimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of\nonline and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench\ndemonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference\noptimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online\nannotation costs.",

        "title": "Alignment through Meta-Weighted Online Sampling: Bridging the Gap\n  between Data Generation and Preference Optimization",
        "summary": "Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)\nwith human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is\nthe distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the\nevolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static\nheuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to\nadapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMeta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework\nthat dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a\nlightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the\npotential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This\nguides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the\noptimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of\nonline and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench\ndemonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference\noptimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online\nannotation costs.",
