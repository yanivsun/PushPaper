In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing\ninternal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This\nprocess both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token\ngeneration latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs\ncommunicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%\nhigher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text\ncommunication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average\n2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.",

Existing methods typically\nemploy tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large\nlanguage models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic\nexpressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To\naddress this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a\ncontinuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and\nunderstanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional\nfeatures, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile\nthese competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture\ninvolving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.\nBuilt on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual\nrepresentations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single\nautoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and\ngeneration as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly\nsupports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,\ngeneration and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous\nvisual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers\nby the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art\nlevel performance across both domains.

Consequently, thinking after\nreceiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,\nwhere real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting\nthat humans naturally \"think while listening.\" In this paper, we propose\nSHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken\nchain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input.

We\ndemonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two\nscenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math\nproblem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a\nmistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that\ninterrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can\ncomplete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn.

To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel\none-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression\nof large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff\nrevitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex\narchitectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning\ngranularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA\nheads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the\niterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an\nerror-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian\nconstruction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,\nassigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error\naccumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise\nsequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration\nprocess. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art\none-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with\nminimal degradation in visual quality.",

Our analysis further reveals\nthat correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,\nwhile incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results\ndemonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform\nalternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results\nhighlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and\nselection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.",

To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We\nprovide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to\nreproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods.

In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution\nDiscrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D^3QE) for autoregressive-generated\nimage detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency\ndistribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We\nintroduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates\ndynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing\nsemantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we\nconstruct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream\nvisual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and\nstrong generalization of D^3QE across different AR models, with robustness to\nreal-world perturbations.

        "summary": "The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image\ngeneration while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.\nUnlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images\nthrough discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image\nsynthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized\nrepresentations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution\nDiscrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D^3QE) for autoregressive-generated\nimage detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency\ndistribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We\nintroduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates\ndynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing\nsemantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we\nconstruct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream\nvisual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and\nstrong generalization of D^3QE across different AR models, with robustness to\nreal-world perturbations.

The PuzzlePlex framework provides a\ncomprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate\nmore challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we\nimplement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this\nbenchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct\nan in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:\ninstruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate\ntheir scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others\nin instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater\nchallenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative.
