As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families.

            "summary": "With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become\nincreasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and\nbioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between\nefficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing\nand explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global\ndependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective\nstate-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n)\ntime and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays\nexponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and\ninformation-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay\nmechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of\nMamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key\ninformation loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity\nmetrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how\nhumans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we\npropose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state\nsummarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention,\nwhich alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity.\nMemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and\nTransformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval,\nwhile delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a\nbreakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for\nultra-long sequence modeling.",

        "summary": "With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become\nincreasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and\nbioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between\nefficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing\nand explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global\ndependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective\nstate-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n)\ntime and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays\nexponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and\ninformation-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay\nmechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of\nMamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key\ninformation loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity\nmetrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how\nhumans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we\npropose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state\nsummarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention,\nwhich alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity.\nMemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and\nTransformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval,\nwhile delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a\nbreakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for\nultra-long sequence modeling.",

To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline\nthat boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced\nmeta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing\nmeta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training\nsources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover,\nour method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts\nthat are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when\nthey are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our\nstrategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training\nefficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain\nbenchmarks.

We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show\nthat hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging\nthe nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.",

        "summary": "Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly\nrelies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1\ncorrectness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many\ntasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers\nunder-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.\nReward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a\ncomplementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show\nthat hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging\nthe nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.",

            "summary": "On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a\nlong-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as\nreal-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:\nper-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,\nwhereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle\nwith accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified\nframework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the\nreliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose\nestimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that\ntransforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both\nfidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian\nrepresentation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering\nfidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and\noutdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance\ncomparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and\nreconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical\npath toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both\naccurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

        "summary": "On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a\nlong-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as\nreal-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:\nper-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,\nwhereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle\nwith accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified\nframework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the\nreliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose\nestimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that\ntransforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both\nfidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian\nrepresentation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering\nfidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and\noutdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance\ncomparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and\nreconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical\npath toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both\naccurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

However, their performance in specialized\nreal-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating\nexternal tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic\nreinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely\non costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output\ndistribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the\noutput distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which\nis a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data\nscarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we\npropose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),\na cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any\nparameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage\ninstead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling\nhigh-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal\nground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is\nseamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments\non mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that\nTraining-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly\nimproves out-of-domain performance.

        "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their\npromising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized\nreal-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating\nexternal tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic\nreinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely\non costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output\ndistribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the\noutput distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which\nis a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data\nscarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we\npropose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),\na cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any\nparameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage\ninstead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling\nhigh-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal\nground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is\nseamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments\non mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that\nTraining-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly\nimproves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,\nTraining-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training\ndata and cost.",

In this paper, we introduce\nUniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from\n70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links\nevidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA\npairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical\nreasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by\nmultiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports\napples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)\nimage-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint\nretrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,\nprompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal\ntext-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly\nmultimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images\nalone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.\nBeyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context\ncomplements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers\nactionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.",

        "summary": "Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for\napplying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,\nyet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in\nisolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture\ndocument-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce\nUniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from\n70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links\nevidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA\npairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical\nreasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by\nmultiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports\napples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)\nimage-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint\nretrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,\nprompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal\ntext-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly\nmultimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images\nalone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.\nBeyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context\ncomplements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers\nactionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.",

We first develop a\nparallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on\nmodels with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our\ninvestigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail\ngeneration, which we attribute to error accumulation and the \"mode-covering\"\nnature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the\nscore-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates\nscore distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM\nwith the \"mode-seeking\" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual\nquality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale\nmodels (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM\nmatches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality\nmetrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning\nor extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate\nhigh-fidelity samples in only 1sim4 steps, accelerating diffusion sampling\nby 15timessim50times. These results position rCM as a practical and\ntheoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion\ndistillation.",

        "title": "Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time\n  Consistency",
        "summary": "This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency\ndistillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.\nAlthough continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled\nand empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its\napplicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due\nto infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and\nthe limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a\nparallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on\nmodels with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our\ninvestigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail\ngeneration, which we attribute to error accumulation and the \"mode-covering\"\nnature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the\nscore-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates\nscore distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM\nwith the \"mode-seeking\" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual\nquality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale\nmodels (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM\nmatches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality\nmetrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning\nor extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate\nhigh-fidelity samples in only 1sim4 steps, accelerating diffusion sampling\nby 15timessim50times. These results position rCM as a practical and\ntheoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion\ndistillation.",

Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains:\n1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for\nQwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning\nagents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as\nSAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing\nImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a\ncomputational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as\na powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing\nsimpler and more robust algorithms.",

Instead of compressing data into\ntokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier\nparadigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal\nmulti-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D\nreconstruction.

Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and\nin-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous\nmethods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and\ntexture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress).

While effective, the target\nnetwork remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of\nslowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online\nnetwork as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to\nlead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both\nworlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the\nMINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our\nmethod, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that\nMINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the\npotential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.\nNotably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based\nand actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO\nextensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well\nas discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO\nconsistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and\neffectiveness.",

        "title": "Use the Online Network If You Can: Towards Fast and Stable Reinforcement\n  Learning",
        "summary": "The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value\nfunctions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target\nnetwork remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of\nslowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online\nnetwork as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to\nlead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both\nworlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the\nMINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our\nmethod, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that\nMINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the\npotential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.\nNotably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based\nand actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO\nextensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well\nas discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO\nconsistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and\neffectiveness.",

Despite progress in\nboth areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains\nlimited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model\nrobustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization\n(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision\nmodels, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore\nthe hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply\nPTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different\noptimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio\n(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different\noptimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only\nisolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and\npropagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized\nmodels from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We\nfind that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not\nremain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest\naccuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware\ntraining under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest\nparameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.",
