Our approach shifts from the\nconventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates\nmulti-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach\nwhere the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view\ngeneration. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers\npoor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase\nfollowed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the\nstrengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video\ndiffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,\nwhich jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge\nthe quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode\npost-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented\nmode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality\nwhile maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps\nfor inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view\nimages and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority and efficiency of our method.",

FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase\nfollowed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the\nstrengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video\ndiffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,\nwhich jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge\nthe quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode\npost-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented\nmode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality\nwhile maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps\nfor inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view\nimages and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority and efficiency of our method.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions\nfor various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement\nlearning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware\nvideo generation and broader applications.",

To\nachieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language\nmodel, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation\ntasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal\ncapabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by\npost-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable\nhuman-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a\nmulti-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex\nand multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and\nspeech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory\nbenchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments\ndemonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source\nmodels and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,\nparticularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B\nis comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general\nbenchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B\nwhile utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results\nagainst similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and\nspeech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source\nfoundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.",

        "summary": "We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large\nlanguage model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B\nparameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering\ncomprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To\nachieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language\nmodel, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation\ntasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal\ncapabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by\npost-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable\nhuman-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a\nmulti-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex\nand multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and\nspeech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory\nbenchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments\ndemonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source\nmodels and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,\nparticularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B\nis comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general\nbenchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B\nwhile utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results\nagainst similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and\nspeech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source\nfoundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.",

            "summary": "While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding,\ndiffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to\ndramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this\npromise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel\ndecoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality\nwhen these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook\nthese inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math\nand coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by\nparallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case\nstudies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data\ndistribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights\nthat highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically\ndesigned for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and\nautoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel\ndecoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and\nautoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can\nsuffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current\nparallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism\nbased on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without\ncompromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative\ndecoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We\nrelease our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient\ndLLMs.",

        "summary": "While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding,\ndiffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to\ndramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this\npromise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel\ndecoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality\nwhen these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook\nthese inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math\nand coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by\nparallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case\nstudies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data\ndistribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights\nthat highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically\ndesigned for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and\nautoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel\ndecoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and\nautoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can\nsuffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current\nparallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism\nbased on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without\ncompromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative\ndecoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We\nrelease our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient\ndLLMs.",

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it\nsurpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided\ntraining as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.\nCode and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1.",

Their rapid adoption also drives the needs of\nGenerative Engine Optimization (GEO), as content providers are eager to gain\nmore traction from them. In this paper, we introduce AutoGEO, a framework to\nautomatically learn generative engine preferences when using retrieved contents\nfor response generation, and rewrite web contents for more such traction.\nAutoGEO first prompts frontier LLMs to explain generative engine preferences\nand extract meaningful preference rules from these explanations. Then it uses\npreference rules as context engineering for AutoGEO_API, a\nprompt-based GEO system, and as rule-based rewards to train\nAutoGEO_Mini, a cost-effective GEO model. Experiments on the standard\nGEO-Bench and two newly constructed benchmarks using real user queries\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGEO in enhancing content traction while\npreserving search utility. Analyses confirm the learned rules' robustness and\nabilities to capture unique preferences in variant domains, and AutoGEO\nsystems' ability to embed them in content optimization. The code is released at\nhttps://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoGEO.",

        "title": "What Generative Search Engines Like and How to Optimize Web Content\n  Cooperatively",
        "summary": "By employing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve documents and generate\nnatural language responses, Generative Engines, such as Google AI overview and\nChatGPT, provide significantly enhanced user experiences and have rapidly\nbecome the new form of search. Their rapid adoption also drives the needs of\nGenerative Engine Optimization (GEO), as content providers are eager to gain\nmore traction from them. In this paper, we introduce AutoGEO, a framework to\nautomatically learn generative engine preferences when using retrieved contents\nfor response generation, and rewrite web contents for more such traction.\nAutoGEO first prompts frontier LLMs to explain generative engine preferences\nand extract meaningful preference rules from these explanations. Then it uses\npreference rules as context engineering for AutoGEO_API, a\nprompt-based GEO system, and as rule-based rewards to train\nAutoGEO_Mini, a cost-effective GEO model. Experiments on the standard\nGEO-Bench and two newly constructed benchmarks using real user queries\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGEO in enhancing content traction while\npreserving search utility. Analyses confirm the learned rules' robustness and\nabilities to capture unique preferences in variant domains, and AutoGEO\nsystems' ability to embed them in content optimization. The code is released at\nhttps://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoGEO.",

        "summary": "Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and\ngeneration, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.\nExisting evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook\ntasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a\ncomprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the\nbidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight\nreasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.\nEach task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage\nconceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize\ngeneration as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU\nincorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and\na reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through\nextensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and\nunderstanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and\ncross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these\nabilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for\nadvancing unified models.",

Unlike\nconventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the\nimage as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the\nimage reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes\nan encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked\nlow-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to\nidentify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to\nreconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the\npre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive\nlearning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration\ntasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained\nencoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve\noutstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves\nperformance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with\na minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and\na 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation\nscenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen\ndegradation types and levels.

        "summary": "Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective\ntraining across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,\nheterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,\ndiverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with\nminimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into\ncross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable\nembeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as\nembodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective\nexploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat\nflow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted\nstandard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.\nEvaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B\ninstantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep\nof benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities,\nfrom flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments,\nand tasks.

Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that\nMTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance\nof environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for\nconversational semantic parsing.

We cast the task as\na Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database\nfor execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence\nverification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine\ncycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that\nMTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance\nof environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for\nconversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,\nlogs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review\nto contribute to community research.",

            "summary": "With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.\nHowever, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical\nlimitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., pass@1024), many\nexisting base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math\nbenchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL\nfine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen\nexisting solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such\nsharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster\nexploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we\nintroduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat\ncommon open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling\nbudgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that\nlearn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated\nsampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and\nDeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school\nmath. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as\nNemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform\npoorly on MATH-B at pass@1024, showing how existing approaches fall\nshort on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze\nexploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We\nrelease MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.",

        "summary": "With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.\nHowever, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical\nlimitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., pass@1024), many\nexisting base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math\nbenchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL\nfine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen\nexisting solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such\nsharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster\nexploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we\nintroduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat\ncommon open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling\nbudgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that\nlearn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated\nsampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and\nDeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school\nmath. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as\nNemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform\npoorly on MATH-B at pass@1024, showing how existing approaches fall\nshort on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze\nexploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We\nrelease MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.",

We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games.
