In this\npaper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to\nimprove vision-language generation.

To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a\nbenchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k\nevaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.\nExperiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k\ncorrectness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment\nperformance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a\nscalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.",

With 484\ntasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from\nfactual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as\nmathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a\nchecklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated\nevaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual\naccuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on\nMultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve\nonly a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the\ndataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue\ncontext significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,\nemphasizing the importance of in-context learning.

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant\nadvances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles\nwith the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed\nWiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing\nstage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal\ninformation for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text\nfeatures to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage\nperforms relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this\nend, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and\nformat consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This\nenhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and\nfiltering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and\nInfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant\nadvances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles\nwith the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed\nWiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing\nstage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal\ninformation for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text\nfeatures to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage\nperforms relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this\nend, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and\nformat consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This\nenhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and\nfiltering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and\nInfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

Our\nprincipal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that\ncombines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with\nSqueeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a\nlearnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this\nlearnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,\nindicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for\nsatellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by\nnetwork depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and\nconfusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's\nKappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating\nconfidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect\npredictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned\nResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of\nsystematic architectural design for domain-specific applications.

        "summary": "This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural\nnetwork architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%\ntest accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.\nThrough three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,\nCBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify\nand address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our\nprincipal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that\ncombines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with\nSqueeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a\nlearnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this\nlearnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,\nindicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for\nsatellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by\nnetwork depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and\nconfusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's\nKappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating\nconfidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect\npredictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned\nResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of\nsystematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete\ncode, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.",

            "summary": "If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether\nor not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on\ngrounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance\nof machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference\ntranslations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible.

        "summary": "If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether\nor not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on\ngrounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance\nof machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference\ntranslations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using\nsegment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to\nevaluate translators.

However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the\ngeometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A\nstraightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we\nshow that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we\npropose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a\npretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free\nmethod interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.\nThis guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we\nexperiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for\nappearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach\nsuccessfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,\noutperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show\nthat traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their\ninability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in\nabsence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with\na GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like\nassessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,\nour method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion\nmodels and guidance functions.",

        "title": "GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer",
        "summary": "Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the\nappearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its\nwide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and\ndigital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the\ngeometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A\nstraightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we\nshow that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we\npropose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a\npretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free\nmethod interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.\nThis guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we\nexperiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for\nappearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach\nsuccessfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,\noutperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show\nthat traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their\ninability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in\nabsence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with\na GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like\nassessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,\nour method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion\nmodels and guidance functions.",
