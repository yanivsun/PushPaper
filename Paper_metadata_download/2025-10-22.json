To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems.

Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for\nevaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality\nsamples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general\ninstruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework\nthat assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content\ncorrectness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a\nnuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the\nperformance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving\nnear-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning\nunderperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that\nfuture work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and\ninstruction-following fidelity.",

Training such models at a\ntrillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including\ntrain-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and\nbottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected\ninnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy\nmasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;\n(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget\nby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and\n(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic\nbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers\nbreakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on\nHMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a\nsilver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional\nreasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the\ncommunity, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge\nreasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in\ndemocratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline\nfor open-source model performance.",

Despite\nclaims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource\nlanguages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not\ntruly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in\nmedium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic\nclustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few\nfull-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a\nback-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost\nthrough translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust\nacross different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable\nto new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17\nlanguages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking\nacross diverse languages.",

        "title": "Is Multilingual LLM Watermarking Truly Multilingual? A Simple\n  Back-Translation Solution",
        "summary": "Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs\ntraceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite\nclaims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource\nlanguages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not\ntruly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in\nmedium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic\nclustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few\nfull-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a\nback-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost\nthrough translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust\nacross different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable\nto new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17\nlanguages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking\nacross diverse languages.",

To address this challenge, we\npresent UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient\nand ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,\nUltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on\nglobal-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a\nlocal attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global\nattention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a\nspatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global\ndependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to\nreduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different\nlocal windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively\nscale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution\nfor the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and\nsuper-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations.",

In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as\na signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of\nmicro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process\ngrounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or\nthinking through an answer). We further observe that once this \"thinking\"\nprocess is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by\nreducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more\ncertain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,\ntheoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at\ninference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during\ninference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the\nvalue cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable\ncontroller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any\ndataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration\nand exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our\nproposed method achieves significant improvements over the base\ninstruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the\ngap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any\ntraining, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced\nby 58.6% compared to the RL model.",

We further observe that once this \"thinking\"\nprocess is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by\nreducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more\ncertain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,\ntheoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at\ninference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during\ninference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the\nvalue cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable\ncontroller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any\ndataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration\nand exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our\nproposed method achieves significant improvements over the base\ninstruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the\ngap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any\ntraining, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced\nby 58.6% compared to the RL model.",

            "summary": "Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal\nmedical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse\noutputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,\nsegmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems\ndisrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret\nimages but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation\nmodels synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to\ngaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal\ncapabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws\ninspiration from diagnostic workflows through the\nObservation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation\nlevel, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that\nreformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational\nobservation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning\nthat systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis\nlevel, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for\nthe simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a\nsingle architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical\nimage understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation\nquality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified\narchitecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance\nvisual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally\nseparate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements\nacross diverse medical vision-language tasks.

        "title": "Unimedvl: Unifying Medical Multimodal Understanding And Generation\n  Through Observation-Knowledge-Analysis",
        "summary": "Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal\nmedical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse\noutputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,\nsegmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems\ndisrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret\nimages but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation\nmodels synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to\ngaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal\ncapabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws\ninspiration from diagnostic workflows through the\nObservation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation\nlevel, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that\nreformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational\nobservation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning\nthat systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis\nlevel, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for\nthe simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a\nsingle architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical\nimage understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation\nquality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified\narchitecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance\nvisual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally\nseparate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements\nacross diverse medical vision-language tasks.

A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further\nenhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool\nfailures.
