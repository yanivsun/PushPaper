Models trained at 16K\neffectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.\nOn Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA\naccuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches\na score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)\nand DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all\n128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning\ncapabilities.",

        "summary": "We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for\nconverting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered\nplain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision\nlanguage model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To\nscale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic\ndocuments with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source\ncode, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases\nresults in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language\nOCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table\nparsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our\nmodel, data and code under permissive open licenses.",

The former,\nsuch as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream\ntasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as leq 0.02% trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:\nhttps://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.",

However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as leq 0.02% trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:\nhttps://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.",

Meanwhile,\nLMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is\nweakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility\nof updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods\nand observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing\nmethods in single editing scenarios.",

Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,\nincluding their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to\nmeaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts\neffectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword\ntokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or\nsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and\nreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,\nrobustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a\nshift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step\ntoward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.",

        "summary": "People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,\nincluding their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to\nmeaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts\neffectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword\ntokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or\nsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and\nreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,\nrobustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a\nshift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step\ntoward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.",

We introduce DeLeaker, a\nlightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage\nby directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion\nprocess, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive\ncross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To\nsupport systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),\nthe first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130\nhuman-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel\nautomatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker\nconsistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with\nexternal information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without\ncompromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of\nattention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.",

        "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable\nto semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features\nbetween distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often\noptimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a\nlightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage\nby directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion\nprocess, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive\ncross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To\nsupport systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),\nthe first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130\nhuman-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel\nautomatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker\nconsistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with\nexternal information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without\ncompromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of\nattention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.",
