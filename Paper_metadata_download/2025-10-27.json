To address this fundamental challenge, we\nreframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We\nintroduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the\nmodel to identify and correct its own errors.

Context\ncompression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective\napproaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its\narchitecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this\nspecific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that\ncompresses the context into continuous representations which replace token\nembeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training\nstrategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the\ndesign of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,\nwhich outputs x-times fewer continuous representations (typically\nx!in!{4,8}) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety\nof LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window\nextension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving\ncomputational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models\ncan be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder\nto generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible\nand efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple\nLLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder\n, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/kyutai/arc-encoders-68ee18787301407d60a57047 .",

However, it remains a significant challenge to learn\nphysics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,\nespecially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.\nTo overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel\nframework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and\ndiverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via\nconstitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical\nproperties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical\nproperties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,\nsynthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these\ndemonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded\nwith physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the\nphysical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions\nfor various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel\ninteractions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while\nenabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art\nmethod, i.e., PhysTwin.",

Specifically, we first\nconstruct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via\nconstitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical\nproperties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical\nproperties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,\nsynthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these\ndemonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded\nwith physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the\nphysical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions\nfor various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel\ninteractions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while\nenabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art\nmethod, i.e., PhysTwin.",

            "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing\nthe capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodels, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to\ncatastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference\nconsistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing\nbehaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,\nthe routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated\nforward passes.

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing\nthe capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodels, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to\ncatastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference\nconsistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing\nbehaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,\nthe routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated\nforward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout\nRouting Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the\ninference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces\ntraining-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies\nwithout compromising training speed.

To\nefficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR\ndata is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their\nangular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric\naccuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing\ngeometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a\ncompression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,\ndemonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This\nparadigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new\npossibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete\ngeometric preservation.",
