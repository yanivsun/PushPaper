We\ndemonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can\ncollect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.\nBuilding on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy\nframework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric\nvision.

The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to\nretrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)\nstrategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,\nthereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.\nThrough model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data\nquality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM^3, a multi-dimensional and\nmulti-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along\nwith 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance\nassessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)\nexperiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning\ncapabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller\nmodels to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex\nchart comprehension.",

            "summary": "Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an\nefficient and reward-free approach to improving video generation quality.\nHowever, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly\ndeveloped on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their\nability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data\nconstruction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds\nhigh-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and\nmodel-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external\nannotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a\nregularization term into the DPO objective to enhance training stability and\ngeneration fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with\nmultiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three\ntimes higher training capacity than using FSDP alone.

        "summary": "Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an\nefficient and reward-free approach to improving video generation quality.\nHowever, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly\ndeveloped on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their\nability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data\nconstruction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds\nhigh-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and\nmodel-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external\nannotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a\nregularization term into the DPO objective to enhance training stability and\ngeneration fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with\nmultiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three\ntimes higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on\nboth I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video\ngeneration quality.",
