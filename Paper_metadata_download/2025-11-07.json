Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a\npromising \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from\nimage-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone\nenables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains\nconstrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.\nTo bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal\nreasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through\nend-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)\na Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies\ninteractive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and\ndifficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns\nperception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce\nVTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive\nreasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently\noutperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive\nreasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing\nimage-interactive reasoning applications.",

        "summary": "Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) system patterns, such as disaggregated\ninference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, and asynchronous reinforcement\nfine-tuning, require flexible point-to-point communication beyond simple\ncollectives. Existing implementations are locked to specific Network Interface\nControllers (NICs), hindering integration into inference engines and\nportability across hardware providers. We present TransferEngine, which bridges\nthe functionality of common NICs to expose a uniform interface. TransferEngine\nexposes one-sided WriteImm operations with a ImmCounter primitive for\ncompletion notification, without ordering assumptions of network transport,\ntransparently managing multiple NICs per GPU. We demonstrate peak throughput of\n400 Gbps on both NVIDIA ConnectX-7 and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). We\nshowcase TransferEngine through three production systems: (1) KvCache transfer\nfor disaggregated inference with dynamic scaling, (2) RL weight updates\nachieving 1.3 seconds for trillion-parameter models, and (3) MoE\ndispatch/combine implementation exceeding DeepEP decode latency on ConnectX-7,\nwith the first viable latencies on EFA. We demonstrate that our portable\npoint-to-point communication complements collectives while avoiding lock-in.",
