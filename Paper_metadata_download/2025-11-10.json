Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal\nannotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.\nTo overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),\nthe first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion\nsequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed\ndata generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each\ncomposed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately\nannotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that\nintegrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to\ngenerate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO\nsubstantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted\nbenchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion\nunderstanding and captioning.",
